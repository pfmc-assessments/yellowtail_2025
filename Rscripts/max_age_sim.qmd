A simple simation was conducted where a constant M was applied to all ages and an F was applied to ages 5 and above (knife-edge selectivity). A random sample of ages was drawn from the population and the observed age was calculated from a normal distribution with assumed CV value for ageing error. Only a single cohort was caculated so nothing is varying or accumulating over time other than the exponential decay in proportions at age.

The design included 
- 3 values of M = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2
- 3 values of F = 0, F = M, or F = 0.2
- 3 values of CV = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3
- 3 values of sample size = 100, 1,000, and 10,000
- 3 sources for the maximum age used to calculate M: 
  - the maximum observed age, 
  - the 0.999 quantile of the observed ages, and 
  - the 0.99 quantile of the observed ages.

The conclusions that I come to from looking at the results include
1. the sample size and F are the two most influential factors
1. if you somehow have ages from cohorts that have experienced F close to 0 for most of their lives, the 0.99 quantile gets you the M estimate which is closest to the true M
1. if you have ages from cohorts which have experienced F close to M, the 0.999 quantile or maximum observed age are better choices
