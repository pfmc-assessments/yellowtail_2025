Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 56  < max pop len bins: 65; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 1 : Block:1 2 ends in: 2024 after retroyr+1:  2023
Warning 2 : Block:2 1 ends in: 2024 after retroyr+1:  2023
Warning 3 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Warning 4 : Suggest using Q option 5 to include offset parameter for an index of deviations (type 35 or 36)
Warning 5 : Final gradient: 1.62464e-05 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
