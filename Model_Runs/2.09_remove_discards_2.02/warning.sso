Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 56  < max pop len bins: 65; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Note 3 Information: Max harvest rate typically is >1.0 for F_method 2, 3 or 4 0.95
Warning 2 Fatal Error!  Q setup error; no survey obs for fleet 1 but Q setup was read
