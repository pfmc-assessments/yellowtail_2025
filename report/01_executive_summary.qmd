# Executive Summary{-}

## Stock{-}

Yellowtail rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*) is a midwater rockfish distributed mainly from Point Conception in California to the Gulf of Alaska, with the highest density around Washington state and British Columbia. Yellowtail are relatively fast-growing and short-lived for a rockfish species, with a maximum size around 55 cm reached around age 15, and few fish observed older than 40. They move farther offshore as they grow older, and are found most consistently from MIN DEPTH to 250 m. There is a genetic break in the population at Cape Mendocino. This assessment is for the northern portion of the stock in U.S. waters, from $40^\circ 10'$ (near Cape Mendocino) to the U.S.-Canada border.

<!-- Species/area, including an evaluation of any potential biological basis for regional management -->

## Catches{-}

Catches have averaged over 3000 mt in recent years, and are mainly from a commercial trawl fishery (@tbl-es-catches, @fig-es-landings). Catches increased substantially with the rebuilding of other midwater rockfish species and coincident reopening of the midwater trawl fishery in 2017. Recreational catches are a minority of the landings, but have also increased in recent years as trips in both Washington and Oregon have moved farther offshore. Yellowtail is frequently caught as a bycatch species in the at-sea hake fishery, though this also represents a minority of catches.

## Data and assessment{-}

The last assessment for the northern stock of Yellowtail rockfish occurred in 2017. The current assessment builds off of that model. It includes catch, length, and age data from three fishery fleets (commercial shoreside, at-sea, recreational),  age, length, and index data for one survey (Triennial), conditional age-at-length, length, and index data for one survey (West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey). The assessment also includes two new fishery-independent indices: a combined hook and line survey from Oregon and Washington, which also includes associated length data, and a recruitment survey from Oregon. The assessment is relatively data-rich, but continued collection of all of these data sources is important for the continued ability to conduct assessments.

<!-- Trends and current levels relative to virgin or historic levels, description of uncertainty-include table for last 10 years and graph with long term estimates. -->

<!-- \clearpage  -->

The model estimates that the population was near the minimum stock size threshold throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but increased through the 2000s to mid 2010s (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl). Since 2017 (coincident with the increase in catches), spawning output has been gradually declining, but is still well above the management target (@tbl-es-sb).

## Recruitment{-}

The largest recruitment event throughout the time series was estimated in 2008, which supported an increase in the population leading up to 2017 (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits). Recruitment is estimated to be relatively low in the later 2010s, but the model estimates that 2021 and 2023 may support large year classes in the future, with the estimate driven by the new recruitment index.

## Exploitation status{-}

Exploitation rates were above the management target throughout the 1980s and 1990s. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to strong trip limits. Like catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017 and have remained stable since then, but are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-spr).

<!-- Exploitation rates (i.e., total catch divided by exploitable biomass, or the annual SPR harvest rate) - include a table with the last 10 years of data and a graph showing the trend in fishing mortality relative to the target (y-axis) plotted against the trend in biomass relative to the target (x-axis). -->

## Ecosystem considerations{-}

The assessment includes a sensitivity model with an oceanographic recruitment index. See risk table for further detail on ecosystem considerations.

## Reference points{-}

A list of estimates of the current population state, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) an SPR of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es.

<!-- Management targets and definitions of overfishing, including the harvest rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at B24% for flatfishes and B40% for all other groundfish stocks (BMSY proxies) and the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate (the FMSY proxy).

## Management performance{-}

Although catch increased substantially in 2017, it has still been well below the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit (@tbl-es-management). Attainment has averaged around 50\% since the increase in landings, and was even lower in prior years.
<!-- Catches in comparison to OFL, ABC, HG, and OY/ACL values for the most recent 10 years (when available), overfishing levels, actual catch and discard. Include OFL (encountered), OFL (retained) and OFL (dead) if different due to discard and discard mortality. -->

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties{-}

The largest uncertainty in this model is the inability to fit a marked increase in the bottom trawl survey from 2014-2019. This coincides with an increase in catch-per-unit-effort from the midwater trawl fishery (which accounts for the majority of landings). The increase is likely due to the record 2008 year class, but the estimated size of the year class does not lead to a large enough increase to fit the survey index, and it is especially hard to fit the sudden decrease and then flattening of the index, given that catches were relatively stable from 2017-2024. The current assessment estimates that the stock is more depleted than it was in 2017, which is likely the case. The magnitude of that difference is more uncertain.

<!-- Any special issues that complicate scientific assessment, questions about the best model scenario, etc. -->

## Decision table and projections{-}

Projections of the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a P* of 0.45 and uncertainty in the overfishing limit of 0.5 are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the allowable biological catch.

<!-- Projected yields (OFL, ABC and ACL), spawning biomass / output, and stock depletion levels for each year. OFL calculations should be based on the assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs. -->

## Scientific uncertainty{-}

The model estimate of the coefficient of variation of the overfishing limit (OFL) in 2025 is `r round(mod_out$derived_quants['OFLCatch_2025', 'StdDev'] / mod_out$derived_quants['OFLCatch_2025', 'Value'], 3)`. This is less than the default SSC value of 0.5 for a category 1 assessment, so harvest projections assume an initial sigma of 0.5, and an increase of 0.075 per year.

## Research and data needs{-}

The most important future research need to better understand catchability of the trawl survey and its drivers. This could help to resolve the mismatch between the survey index and composition data. Continued collection of age and other biological samples across gear types and fleets is also critical.

### Ecosystem and Environmental Conditions{-}
Contributed by: Megan Feddern, Isaac Kaplan, Nick Tolimieri, Chris Harvey and Jameal Samhouri

To identify ecosystem and environmental processes impacting northern Yellowtail rockfish we evaluated recent trends in environmental drivers, focusing on the years after main recruitment deviations are estimated (2019 - 2025). We considered trends in environmental drivers of Yellowtail recruitment, habitat and distribution, prey, competitors and predators, and the climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) by @mcclure2023. We did not consider non-fisheries human activities as none were identified to be applicable to Yellowtail. Overall we consider ecosystem and environmental conditions to be neutral (Level 2) with medium to high confidence based on agreement between a majority of indicators, robust but uncertain evidence, and no apparent concerns. We use this, plus information related to the stock assessment, to fill out the ‘risk table’ in @tbl-risk, based on the framework outlined by the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) team [@Golden2024].

#### Recruitment{-}
La Niña conditions persisted from 2020 - 2022 but were followed by a strong El Niño in 2023 - 24, which caused warmer than average ocean temperatures that were particularly pronounced during the pelagic juvenile lifestage and which are negatively associated with Yellowtail recruitment. Spring transition was substantially earlier than optimal for northern Yellowtail in 2020 and later than optimal in 2022, but close to optimal in 2021, 2023 and 2024 based on the relationships described in CITE OCEANOGRAPHIC APPENDIX. Temperature exposure during egg incubation was above average in 2021 and 2023, indicating poor conditions, but average in 2024. Since 2019, longshore transport has been substantially above average during the pelagic juvenile lifestage indicating poor conditions for recruitment. 

The Washington nearshore rockfish survey in OCNMS [@Tolimieri2023; @Cope2023wa], which was updated through 2024 for this assessment, indicated an increase in the Black-Yellowtail species complex from 2019 - 2021, low abundance in 2022 - 2023, and an increase in 2024. Similar patterns were observed based on the northern YOY rockfish index from the RREAS survey [@Gasbarro2025], with a more optimistic outlook of abundance in 2023. The coastwide RREAS index for Yellowtail also indicated a strong YOY class in 2024 [@Field2021; @santora2021], but had less interannual variability from 2021 - 2023 (@fig-YOY). The collective evidence across oceanographic indices of recruitment and indices of juvenile abundance indicates recruitment was average or below the long-term average over the last 5 years with the exception of 2021.

Overall, based on the collective evidence recruitment is characterized as neutral to unfavorable conditions with robust evidence. 

#### Distribution and Habitat{-}
Young of the year Yellowtail rockfish settle to nearshore areas and are known to utilize kelp bed habitat. Giant and bull kelp abundance based on the Kelp Watch Report Card remain close to the historical average in Washington [@Bell2023]. However, Oregon bull kelp cover is low, and is estimated to be at only 39% of historical levels, and over the last five years cover has been at only 19% of historical levels. Kelp abundance in California regions is also low relative to the historical mean. @Tolimieri2020 and @Taylor_petrale_2023 used spatio-temporal models to examine the distribution and abundance of groundfish along the West Coast. We considered updated spatio-temporal models for young (less than 4.5 years) and adult Yellowtail rockfish, separately. These models indicate no changes in distribution. Collectively, habitat and distribution information indicate neutral to somewhat unfavorable conditions due to low kelp cover in Oregon. 

#### Prey{-}

Overall, most available evidence suggests adequate forage for yellowtail in 2024 and recent years and is characterized as neutral to favorable. The CCIEA RREAS euphausiid (krill) indicator shows an increasing trend in the central Central California Current over the last five years, including 2024 (@Leising2025; see Figure I.2). RREAS data for 42 - 46 degrees N indicates no strong trend over the last five years, and krill abundance and size from the Trinidad Head Line were near average for most of 2024. Herring abundance sampled by JSOES  in the Northern California Current has been stable in recent years, although the 2023 acoustic survey estimates of coastwide herring abundance suggest a decline from 2019 levels  [@stierhoff2024distribution]. Production of juvenile hake was estimated in the stock assessment to be above average in 2020 and 2021, though there is high uncertainty in the stock assessment estimates of recruitment for more recent years [@Johnson2025]. Copepods are found in diets of juvenile yellowtail, and sampling at the Newport Hydrographic Line (@Leising2025; see Figure 3.1) suggested average feeding conditions over the last 5 years, with improvements once El Niño conditions waned in early 2024. We note that the coastwide krill abundance index, derived from acoustic data, was not available in 2024, but the 2023 values for this index were the 2nd lowest since the beginning of sampling in 2007.

#### Predators and Competitors{-}

Predators that impose the largest amounts of predation mortality on yellowtail rockfish were identified from Ecopath food web modeling. The Ecopath models of @field2006top and @koehn2016 were recently revised (C.  Best-Otubu, P.Y. Hernvann, N. Lezama Ochoa, I. Kaplan). The highest sources of predation mortality on Yellowtail rockfish, from greatest to least, derive from seven predators: California sea lions, lingcod, porpoises, fur seals, harbor seals, sablefish and skates. Based on changes in abundance over the last 5 years, six of the seven main predators are unlikely to drive any changes in predation over the last 5 years [@Caretta2024; @Taylor2019; @Gertseva2019; @Taylor2021]. One predator, sablefish, may have imposed some increased predation pressure on the ecosystem [@Johnson2023], but the linkage to yellowtail specifically is very uncertain. Similarly, we considered hake as a potential competitor for krill, however the lack of evidence of krill being a limiting prey source for Yellowtail and lack of direct evidence of competition makes this link highly uncertain. Overall, we scored predation and competition effects  as neutral, with some uncertainty.

#### Climate Vulnerability Assessment{-}

@mcclure2023 found that Yellowtail rockfish had a climate vulnerability of moderate/high and an overall climate exposure of high, due largely to potential impacts from ocean acidification on prey (ranked very high) and mean sea surface temperature (ranked high). We consider the effects of temperature and prey availability to be well informed in other sections of this risk table and the assessment and as a result the CVA ranking was not included in our final scoring of the ecosystem and environmental considerations.
