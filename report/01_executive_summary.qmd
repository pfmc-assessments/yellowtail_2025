# Executive Summary

## Stock{-}

Yellowtail rockfish (*Sebastes flavidus*) is a midwater rockfish distributed mainly from Point Conception in California to the Gulf of Alaska, with the highest density around Washington state and British Columbia. Yellowtail are relatively fast-growing and short-lived for a rockfish species, with a maximum size around 55 cm reached around age 15, and few fish observed older than 40. They move farther offshore and northward as they grow older, and are found most consistently up to 250 m depth. There is a genetic break in the population at Cape Mendocino. This assessment is for the northern portion of the stock in U.S. waters, from $40^\circ 10'$ N latitude (near Cape Mendocino) to the U.S.-Canada border.

<!-- Species/area, including an evaluation of any potential biological basis for regional management -->

## Catches{-}

Catches have averaged over 3,000 mt in recent years, and are mainly from a commercial trawl fishery (@tbl-es-catches, @fig-es-landings). Catches increased substantially with the rebuilding of other midwater rockfish species and coincident reopening of the midwater trawl fishery in 2017. Recreational catches are a minority of the landings, but have also increased in recent years as trips in both Washington and Oregon have moved farther offshore. Yellowtail is frequently caught as a bycatch species in the at-sea hake fishery, though this also represents a minority of catches.

## Data and assessment{-}

The last assessment for the northern stock of yellowtail rockfish (defined identically) occurred in 2017. The current assessment builds off of that model. It includes catch, length, and age data from three fishery fleets (commercial shoreside, at-sea, recreational),  age, length, and index data for one survey (Triennial), conditional age-at-length, length, and index data for one survey (West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey). The assessment also includes two new fishery-independent indices: a combined hook and line survey from Oregon and Washington, which also includes associated length data, and a recruitment survey from Oregon. The assessment is relatively data-rich, but continued collection of all of these data sources is important for the continued ability to conduct assessments.

## Stock spawning output and dynamics{-}

<!-- Trends and current levels relative to virgin or historic levels, description of uncertainty-include table for last 10 years and graph with long term estimates. -->

<!-- \clearpage  -->

The model estimates that the population was near the minimum stock size threshold throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but increased through the 2000s to mid 2010s (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl). Since 2017 (coincident with the increase in catches), spawning output has been gradually declining, but is still well above the management target of 40% of unfished spawning depletion (@tbl-es-sb).

## Recruitment{-}

The estimated largest recruitment event throughout the time series was in 2008, which supported an increase in the population leading up to 2017 (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits). Recruitment is estimated to be relatively low in the later 2010s, but the model estimates that 2021 and 2023 may support large year classes in the future, with the estimates driven by the new recruitment index for both years.

<!-- \clearpage -->
## Exploitation status{-}

Exploitation rates were above the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a spawning potential ratio of 0.5 throughout the 1980s and 1990s. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to restrictive trip limits. As with catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017, have remained stable since then, and are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).

<!-- Exploitation rates (i.e., total catch divided by exploitable biomass, or the annual SPR harvest rate) - include a table with the last 10 years of data and a graph showing the trend in fishing mortality relative to the target (y-axis) plotted against the trend in biomass relative to the target (x-axis). -->

## Ecosystem considerations{-}

The assessment includes a sensitivity model with an oceanographic recruitment index. A number of ecosystem and environmental conditions were compiled by a team of ecosystem scientists at the NWFSC specific to the life history and distribution of northern yellowtail. These conditions included an evaluation of oceanographic conditions impacting recruitment, habitat change, prey availability, predator and competitor abundance, and climate vulnerability. 

## Reference points{-}

A list of estimates of the current state of the population, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) a spawning potential ratio of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es. SPR, or the spawning potential ratio, is the fraction of expected lifetime reproductive output under a given fishing intensity divided by unfished expected lifetime reproductive output.

<!-- Management targets and definitions of overfishing, including the harvest rate that brings the stock to equilibrium at B24% for flatfishes and B40% for all other groundfish stocks (BMSY proxies) and the equilibrium stock size that results from fishing at the default harvest rate (the FMSY proxy). Include a summary table that compares estimated reference points for SSB, SPR, Exploitation Rate and Yield based on SSB proxy for MSY, SPR proxy for MSY, and estimated MSY values. -->

## Management performance{-}

Although catch increased substantially in 2017, it has still been well below the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit (@tbl-es-management). Attainment of the OFL has averaged around 50\% since the increase in landings, and was even lower in prior years.
<!-- Catches in comparison to OFL, ABC, HG, and OY/ACL values for the most recent 10 years (when available), overfishing levels, actual catch and discard. Include OFL (encountered), OFL (retained) and OFL (dead) if different due to discard and discard mortality. -->

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties{-}

The largest uncertainty in this model is the inability to fit a marked increase in the bottom trawl survey from 2014-2019. This coincides with an increase in catch-per-unit-effort from the midwater trawl fishery (which accounts for the majority of landings). The increase is likely due to the record 2008 year class, but the estimated size of the year class does not lead to a large enough increase to fit the survey index, and it is especially hard to fit the sudden decrease and then flattening of the index, given the estimated natural mortality rate and that catches were relatively stable from 2017-2024. The current assessment estimates that the stock is more depleted than it was in 2017, the time of the last assessment, which is likely the case. The magnitude of that difference is more uncertain.

<!-- Any special issues that complicate scientific assessment, questions about the best model scenario, etc. -->

## Decision table and harvest projections{-}

Projections of the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a P* of 0.45 and a log-space standard deviation of the overfishing limit of 0.5 are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the acceptable biological catch.

<!-- Projected yields (OFL, ABC and ACL), spawning biomass / output, and stock depletion levels for each year. OFL calculations should be based on the assumption that future catches equal ABCs and not OFLs. -->

## Scientific uncertainty{-}

The model estimate of the log-scale standard deviation of the overfishing limit (OFL) in 2025 is `r round(mod_out$OFL_sigma, 3)`. This is less than the default SSC value of 0.5 for a category 1 assessment, so harvest projections assume an initial sigma of 0.5.

## Research and data needs{-}

The most important future research need is to better understand the catchability of the trawl survey and its drivers. This could help to resolve the mismatch between the survey index and composition data. Continued collection of age and other biological samples across gear types and fleets is also critical.

To identify ecosystem and environmental processes impacting northern yellowtail rockfish we evaluated recent trends in environmental drivers, focusing on the years after main recruitment deviations are estimated (2019 - 2025). We considered trends in environmental drivers of yellowtail recruitment, habitat and distribution, prey, competitors and predators, and the climate vulnerability assessment (CVA) by @mcclure2023. We did not consider non-fisheries human activities as none were identified to be applicable to yellowtail. Overall we consider ecosystem and environmental conditions to be neutral (Level 2) with medium to high confidence based on agreement between a majority of indicators, robust but uncertain evidence, and no apparent concerns. We use this, plus information related to the stock assessment, to fill out the ‘risk table’ in @tbl-risk, based on the framework outlined by the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) team [@Golden2024].
