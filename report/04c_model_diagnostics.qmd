## Model Diagnostics

<!-- If a range of model runs is used to characterize uncertainty, it is important to provide some qualitative or quantitative information about relative probability of each. If no statements about relative probability can be made, then it is important to state that all scenarios (or all scenarios between the bounds depicted by the runs) are equally likely.  
If possible, ranges depicting uncertainty should include at least three runs: (a) one judged most probable; (b) at least one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of lower current biomass levels; and (c) one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of higher current biomass levels. The entire range of uncertainty should be carried through stock projections and decision table analyses.  -->

### Convergence
```{r} 
#| label: 'jitter'
#| echo: false 
#| eval: true 
jit <- read.csv(here::here("report/diagnostics/jitter_results.csv"))
jit_good <- sum(jit$Lowest.NLL == "Best Fit")
jit_total <- nrow(jit)
```

The maximum parameter gradient was `r signif(mod_out$maximum_gradient_component, 2)` and the jitter analysis showed that `r jit_good` out of `r jit_total` model runs with jittered initial values converged to the same model estimate.

### Sensitivity Analyses

<!-- Sensitivity to assumptions about model structure, i.e., model specification uncertainty.  -->

<!-- Sensitivity to data set choice (e.g., using emphasis factors to selectively remove data sources) and weighting schemes (e.g., MacAllister & Ianelli weighting versus Francis weighting vs. Dirichlet weighting for compositional data), which may also include a consideration of recent patterns in recruitment.  -->
 
### Retrospective Analysis

The retrospective analysis showed little change in the population trajectory (@fig-retro1).
<!-- Retrospective analysis, where the model is fitted to a series of shortened input data sets, with the most recent years of input data being dropped.  -->
 
<!-- Historical analysis (plot of actual estimates from current and previous assessments).  -->
TODO: add text about historical analysis: @fig-historical

### Likelihood Profiles

<!-- Evaluation of model parameters. Likelihood profile for the base model over key parameters (typically natural morality, stock-recruit steepness, and equilibrium recruitment, or R0). The profile should indicate all likelihood values for individual components (e.g., indices by survey, compositional data for each type and fleet).   -->
TODO: add text here
Profiles are illustrated in figures @fig-r0-profile to @fig-h-profile-pars.
Specific figures are @fig-r0-profile, @fig-r0-profile-pars, @fig-m-profile, @fig-m-profile-pars, @fig-h-profile, @fig-h-profile-pars.

## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

The composition data regularly include 30+ year-old fish, and support a medium-lived population. The likelihood profiles indicate the survey likelihood is maximized at a lower natural mortality. However, the \gls{s-wcgbt} index doubles and then halves again over a period of approximately five years, and the model is not able to fit this dynamic. Intuitively, a higher natural mortality could make the population more dynamic. While the doubling could come from the large 2008 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 year classes, the estimated recruitment deviation is not large enough to support the magnitude of the increase observed in the survey (and in commercial midwater trawl catch rates). In addition, it is difficult for a population with relatively constant catches since 2017 that regularly lives 30+ years to have adult biomass cut approximately in half over two years (2019-2021). While changes in natural mortality could be possible, ocean conditions were relatively positive during those years (CITE ESR) and changes in natural mortality more often impact younger individuals. Overall, we were unable to find a reliable mechanistic way to simultaneously fit the survey and composition data; the candidate base model fits the composition data at the expense of the survey index.
