## Model Diagnostics

```{=html}
<!-- If a range of model runs is used to characterize uncertainty, it is important to provide some qualitative or quantitative information about relative probability of each. If no statements about relative probability can be made, then it is important to state that all scenarios (or all scenarios between the bounds depicted by the runs) are equally likely.  
If possible, ranges depicting uncertainty should include at least three runs: (a) one judged most probable; (b) at least one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of lower current biomass levels; and (c) one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of higher current biomass levels. The entire range of uncertainty should be carried through stock projections and decision table analyses.  -->

### Convergence

```{r}
#| label: 'jitter'
#| echo: false 
#| eval: true 
jit <- read.csv(here::here("report/diagnostics/jitter_results.csv"))
jit_good <- sum(jit$Lowest.NLL == "Best Fit")
jit_total <- nrow(jit)
```

The maximum parameter gradient was `r signif(mod_out$maximum_gradient_component, 2)` and the jitter analysis showed that `r jit_good` out of `r jit_total` model runs with jittered initial values converged to the same model estimate.

### Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted a number of model runs exploring sensitivity of the model to decisions regarding data and model structure. They are briefly described below:

-   Index sensitivities
    -   Remove all indices (Triennial, WCGBTS, SMURF, combined hook and line)

    -   Remove SMURF index

    -   Add fishery-dependent WCGOP index

    -   Add oceanographic index (included as index of raw recruitment deviations, only include years not present in training data: 2019-2024, fix catchability to one to avoid estimating catchability that aligns with the recruitment deviation prior pulling recruitment deviations to zero, given no other data sources to inform recruitment during these years)

    -   Add ORBS index (no added SE)

    -   Add ORBS index (with added SE)

    -   Add RREAS index (included as index of absolute recruitment)

    -   Upweight WCGBTS index (fix SE of log of index to 0.05)
    
-   Model sensitivities

    -   Estimate 1) natural mortality for all males and females through age 9, 2) natural mortality for females aged 10 and older (based on age at 50% maturity of 10)
    
    -   No sex selectivity for the recreational fleet
    
    -   Estimate sex selectivity for all trawl fleets (ascending limb and scale)
    
    -   Estimate shared natural mortality for males and females
    
    -   Time-varying weight-length relationship for years with WCGBTS data
    
    -   Hybrid F method (SHORT DESCRIPTION)
    
    -   Estimate a density-dependent parameter for WCGBTS catchability
    
-   Composition data sensitivities

    -   McAllister & Ianelli data weighting
    
    -   Remove all lengths from fishery data (selectivity remains length-based and is based on the growth curve estimated from survey data and age compositions from fishery fleets)
    
    -   Add unsexed commercial lengths
    
    -   This is short. Could add: unexpanded PacFIN data, only include comp data from WA. (assume OR/CA would have opposite effect, WA has advantage of aging rec fish)

#### Indices

The ORBS index suggests a higher unfished population scale and lower terminal year depletion below the management target. Unfished recruitment is actually lower, but natural mortality is also lower, and the growth curves differ (lower L$_\infty$, higher K, more similar growth for males and females in model with ORBS index). Overall these differences result in a higher unfished spawning output, similar terminal year spawning output, and therefore lower terminal year relative spawning output. However, the input standard errors on the ORBS index are lower than for any of the fishery-independent indices, which is likely unrealistic. When the model is given the freedom to downweight the index by estimating an additional standard error, the model trajectory is very similar to the base model.

Removing all indices results in a larger unfished recruitment, higher natural mortality, and similar unfished spawning output compared to the base model. (That unfished recruitment and natural mortality change in concert both with the addition of the ORBS index and removal of all indices is not surprising. The base model hessian estimates a correlation between log(R0) and female natural mortality of `r dplyr::filter(mod_out$CoVar, label.i == 'SR_LN(R0)', label.j == 'NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1') |> pull(corr) |> round(2)`.) Upweighting the \gls{s-wcgbt} by forcing the standard error of the log of the index to be 0.05 (compared to an average input value of `r mod_in$dat$CPUE |> dplyr::filter(index == 6) |> with(mean(se_log)) |> round(2)` in the base model) has the opposite effect of removing all indices (lower unfished recruitment, lower natural mortality, slightly higher unfished spawning output). Upweighting the WCGBTS also suggests that the peak in the combined hook and line index is slightly inconsistent with the peak in the \gls{s-wcgbt} index. The peak in the hook and line index would need to occur approximately two years earlier for the surveys to be fully consistent, given the selectivities estimated from the composition data associated with the two surveys. Notably, the run with the upweighted WCGBTS index has a problematic pattern in the early recruitment deviations, all of which are below zero, suggesting parameter estimates may be biased.

All other sensitivities to index data led to only minor changes during the estimation period. However, choice of recruitment index does influence the population forecast, particularly beginning around 2030. Including the RREAS index results in the highest absolute and relative spawning output during the forecast because the survey has been well above average since 2021. The SMURF index (base model), has the next highest forecast due to high observations in 2021 and 2023. A model with no recruitment index (no SMURF) is third highest. The model with the oceanographic index has the lowest forecast, though is only slightly lower than a model with no recruitment index. While the oceanographic index indicates higher recruitment in 2021 than in surrounding years, it predicts that the recruitment deviation is close to zero in 2021, and below average in all other years. ("Catchability," or the scaling factor for the index was fixed to one. The only other informative "data" during the period the index is included is the prior pulling recruitment deviations to zero. As a result, catchability is estimated to minimize the magnitude of recruitment deviations and the survey becomes uninformative. Because the model for the oceanographic index was trained on absolute recruitment deviations from a near-to-final base model, fixing catchability at one seemed like a reasonable assumption.) The models with the RREAS and SMURF indices estimate that recruitment was well above average either for 2021-2024 (RREAS), or in 2021 and 2023 (SMURF). The RREAS index was not included in the base model because it did not appear correlated to recruitment for well-estimated year classes, and predicted high recruitment in years with not particularly notable year classes, while missing the large year classes in 2008 and 2010. The SMURF index is not long enough to compare to recruitment in any well-estimated years. (Exploratory 15-year retrospectives indicated year class strength stabilizes around age 10.) While the oceanographic index can be estimated as far back as 1992 (MEGAN?), recruitment deviation estimates through X were used to train the model, so comparing the index to recruitment estimates prior to X would be circular.

### Retrospective Analysis

The retrospective analysis showed little change in the population trajectory (@fig-retro1). <!-- Retrospective analysis, where the model is fitted to a series of shortened input data sets, with the most recent years of input data being dropped.  -->

<!-- Historical analysis (plot of actual estimates from current and previous assessments).  -->

### Likelihood Profiles

<!-- Evaluation of model parameters. Likelihood profile for the base model over key parameters (typically natural morality, stock-recruit steepness, and equilibrium recruitment, or R0). The profile should indicate all likelihood values for individual components (e.g., indices by survey, compositional data for each type and fleet).   -->

TODO: add text here. Specifically reference the profile run with M fixed at the prior value (or as close as it got) instead of doing a separate sensitivity on that. Profiles are illustrated in figures @fig-r0-profile to @fig-h-profile-pars. Specific figures are @fig-r0-profile, @fig-r0-profile-pars, @fig-m-profile, @fig-m-profile-pars, @fig-h-profile, @fig-h-profile-pars.

## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

The composition data regularly include 30+ year-old fish, and support a medium-lived population. The likelihood profiles indicate the survey likelihood is maximized at a lower natural mortality than the estimated value. However, the \gls{s-wcgbt} index doubles and then halves again over a period of approximately five years, and the model is not able to fit this dynamic. Intuitively, a higher natural mortality could make the population more dynamic, so it is unclear why the survey likelihood is maximized at a lower natural mortality. The doubling could come from the large 2008 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 year classes, but the estimated recruitment deviation is not large enough to support the magnitude of the increase observed in the survey (and in observer catch rates on midwater trawl vessels). In addition, it is difficult for a population with relatively constant catches since 2017 and with individuals that regularly survive to 30+ years to have adult biomass decrease by approximately one-half over only two years (2019-2021). While changes in natural mortality could be possible, ocean conditions were relatively positive during those years (CITE ESR) and changes in natural mortality more often impact younger individuals. The large 2008 year class becomes less apparent in age-composition data in different years for the commercial fleet and the \gls{s-wcgbt}, and the mechanism for this "blurring" is unclear (several hypotheses: movement and selectivity changes, natural mortality, fishing mortality, increasing aging error as the year class gets older). Overall, we were unable to find a reliable mechanistic way to simultaneously fit the survey and composition data; the candidate base model fits the composition data at the expense of the survey index. All data sources and the candidate base model indicate the population is at a more depleted state than it was in 2017 and than the 2017 assessment estimated the population was in 2017 (two distinct quantities). The magnitude of the change is less clear.
