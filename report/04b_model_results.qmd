## Base Model Results

### Parameter Estimates

Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty is based on the assumption of asymptotic multi-variate normality of the maximum likelihood estimate, where the variance-covariance matrix is the inverse of the hessian matrix. Exploratory MCMC runs indicated that posterior distributions largely matched these asymptotic distributions, but took much longer to produce. A list of fixed and estimated parameters in the model and asymptotic standard error estimates for estimated parameters is available in @tbl-pars.

Selectivity curves by length and age indicate that all trawl-based gears have fairly similar selectivities (@fig-sel-length, @fig-sel-age). Time-varying selectivity for the at-sea hake and recreational fleets is in @fig-sel-tv.

The expected stock recruit relationship with estimated recruitment indicates a weak stock-recruit relationship over the observed range of spawning output (@fig-s-r). Recruitment was highest in 2008. This strong year class was apparent across all sources of age data, and also supported by both the hook and line and bottom trawl surveys. 

The estimated length-age relationship is in @fig-growth1, and the relationship between growth (estimated internally), maturity (estimated externally) and weight (estimated externally) is in @fig-growth2.

### Fits to the Data

The model fits all indicies reasonably well with the exception of the \gls{s-wcgbt} index which has a group of large observations (4 out of the 6 years in 2014-2019) which are not fit well (@fig-indices_fit). The challenge of fitting these points is discussed in @sec-unresolved. The \gls{s-tri} shows changes among the years 1995, 1998, and 2001 which are too large to represent population dynamics and are also not fit will by the model. The fit to the SMURF index is achieved through estimates of recruitment devations during the period covered (2014--2024) but the penalty on deviations away from zero associated with the sigmaR parameter leads to less good fits to the low observation in 2015 and the high observations in 2021 and 2023.

### Population Trajectory

The estimated population trajectory indicates the population declined slowly with the initial onset of fishing, and then declined steeply with the onset of the midwater trawl fishery around 1980 and was near the minimum stock size threshold throughout the 1980s and 90s; it then increased beginning around 2000, peaked around 2012, and has been declining in recent years, but is currently estimated to be well above the management target (@tbl-ts, @fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl, @fig-es-recruits, @fig-es-spr).
