## Base Model Results


### Parameter Estimates

<!-- Table listing all explicit parameters in the stock assessment model used for base model, their purpose (e.g., recruitment parameter, selectivity parameter) and whether or not the parameter was actually estimated in the stock assessment model. Include the associated asymptotic standard error estimates.  -->

<!-- Population numbers and biomass at age × year × sex (if sex-specific M, growth, or selectivity) (may be provided as a text, csv, or spreadsheet file). This is not required while undergoing review. Can be included in electronic appendices (SS report files), should be provided as supplementary material for assessments developed with alternative assessment platforms.  -->

<!-- 4. Selectivity estimates (if not included elsewhere). 5. Stock-recruitment relationship. 6. Clear description of units for all outputs.  -->

<!-- Parameter uncertainty (variance estimation conditioned on a given model, estimation framework, data set choice, and weighting scheme). This element for evaluating uncertainty includes expressing uncertainty in derived outputs of the model and estimating CVs using appropriate methods (e.g., bootstrap, asymptotic methods, Bayesian approaches, such as MCMC).   -->

### Fits to the Data

The model fits all indicies reasonably well with the exception of the \gls{s-wcgbt} index which has a group of large observations (4 out of the 6 years in 2014-2019) which are not fit well (@fig-indices_fit). The challenge of fitting these points is discussed in @sec-unresolved. The \gls{s-tri} shows changes among the years 1995, 1998, and 2001 which are too large to represent population dynamics and are also not fit will by the model. The fit to the SMURF index is achieved through estimates of recruitment devations during the period covered (2014--2024) but the penalty on deviations away from zero associated with the sigmaR parameter leads to less good fits to the low observation in 2015 and the high observations in 2021 and 2023.
