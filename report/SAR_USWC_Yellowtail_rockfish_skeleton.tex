\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Yellowtail Rockfish, \emph{Sebastes flavidus}, occur off the West Coast
of the United States from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.
Yellowtail is a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from
Central California to British Columbia (\citeproc{ref-Love2011}{Love
2011}). Because it is an aggregating, midwater species it is usually
caught in the commercial midwater trawl fishery. In California there is
a large recreational fishery as well. The center of Yellowtail Rockfish
abundance is from southern Oregon through British Columbia
(\citeproc{ref-Fraidenburg1980}{Fraidenburg 1980}). Yellowtail Rockfish
are colloquially known as ``greenies'', although \emph{flavidus} is
Latin for ``yellow'' (\citeproc{ref-Love2011}{Love 2011}). We briefly
summarize Yellowtail Rockfish life history, fisheries, assessment and
management here, but in-depth, extensive background information on
Yellowtail Rockfish and other managed species is available at
(\citeproc{ref-PFMC2016}{Council 2016}).

A number of studies correlate environmental conditions to pelagic
juvenile abundance and juvenile recruitment of rockfishes, including
Yellowtail Rockfish. Year-class strength is particularly impacted during
the early larval phase, and annual pelagic juvenile abundance is
correlated with physical conditions, especially upwelling strength along
the coast (e.g., (\citeproc{ref-Field2005}{Field and Ralston 2005}),
(\citeproc{ref-Laidig2007}{Laidig, Chess, and Howard 2007}),
(\citeproc{ref-Laidig2010}{Laidig 2010}),
(\citeproc{ref-Ralston2013}{Ralston and Stewart 2013})).

A recent genetic study (\citeproc{ref-Hess2011}{Hess, Vetter, and Moran
2011}) indicates that there are in fact two stocks of Yellowtail
Rockfish, with a genetic cline at Cape Mendocino, California, roughly
\(40^\circ 10^\prime\) North Latitude. This study of 1013 fish from 21
sites along the West Coast from Mexico through Alaska examined two
datasets, one of mitochondrial DNA, and one of nuclear DNA
microsattelite loci. Findings in both datasets agreed, and also concur
with the findings of Field and Ralston (\citeproc{ref-Field2005}{Field
and Ralston 2005}) who looked at differences in recruitment trends
related to physical forcing and coherence along the coast, and found the
greatest differences among the U.S. and Canadian stocks to be defined by
Cape Mendocino. Neither the genetic study nor the oceanographic studies
definitively identify mechanisms of stock isolation, however they
suggest that a combination of physical forcing due to offshore advection
and differences in available habitat across Cape Mendocino may together
account for the differences observed.

The species has never had a full length and age integrated assessment
south of Cape Mendocino, mainly due to a lack of fishery-independent
data; this assessment represents an initial attempt to do so.

A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for
fisheries or data collection strata is provided in Figure
\ref{fig:assess_region_map}.

\paragraph{Oregon ORBS Dockside Index (2001 -
2024)}\label{oregon-orbs-dockside-index-2001---2024}

Trip-level catch-per-unit-effort data from ORBS dockside sampling was
obtained from ODFW. To mitigate the confounding of hourly effort
associated with these trips with travel, the travel time was subtracted
from the hours fished. Travel time was stratified by boat type (charter
and private) and was calculated as boat type-specific speeds (13 mph for
charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips) multiplied by
twice the distance between the port of origin and the reef that was
fished. CPUE, expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated
by multiplying the number of anglers and the adjusted travel time. The
database contains information on catch by species (number of retained
fish), effort (angler hours), sample location (port where data were
collected), date, bag limits and other relevant regulations, boat type
(charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom associated fish).

The unfiltered data set contained 456,172 trips from 2001 - 2024.
Multiple standardized filters are applied to ORBS trip-level data to
remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters include
trips with incorrect interview times, which impact calculation of
effort, unreasonably long or short trips, and retaining only bottomfish
target trips. Further filters were utilized for fishing closures
(i.e.~temporal or spatial closures) and catches exceeding bag limits,
which would presumably impact catch rates. Trips from several ports with
extremely small sample sizes (\textless1\% of total trips) were also
excluded and finally, trips that met criteria for irrational effort
reporting (i.e., implausible values) or extreme catch rates were
excluded as well. The final dataset included 137,502 trips (TABLE
``percent\_pos.csv'').

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to
fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), boat type and the daily bag
limit for Yellowtail Rockfish. Preliminary model explorations indicated
that the daily bag limit covariate could not be combined with the open
depth of the fishery due to changes in recreational fishing regulations
over time. Prior to 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were included in the
general marine bag limit. However, in 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were
also included in a specialized longleader recreational bag limit where
participants were required to be outside of 40fm. As a result, the bag
limits were binned into a binary covariate for low (5 -- 8 fish) and
high (10 -- 15fish) bag limits during the 2001 -- 2024 time period.
Negative binomial models were fit in sdmTMB (Version 0.6.0) to the
trip-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours).
Tweedie distributions were also explored for selected models but
generally did not improve model diagnostics. The final model selected
includes year, month, port, open fishery depths, longleader trip and
binned target bag limit covariates, which was the best fit model by AIC
in this series (TABLE ``model\_selection.csv''). Acceptable diagnostics
for the model were achieved (FIGURE -- qqplot) and the negative binomial
distribution was preferred over the tweedie. The index of abundance are
shown in Figure/Table XXXX.

\subsection{Fishery-independent data}\label{fishery-independent-data}

\subsubsection{Abundance Indices}\label{abundance-indices-1}

\paragraph{SMURF YOY Index}\label{smurf-yoy-index}

ODFW and Oregon State University (OSU) have collaborated on young of the
year (YOY) fish and environmental monitoring in and around Oregon Marine
Reserves (MR) using SMURF devices, standardized sampling units that
collect newly-settled juvenile fishes. Data were provided for two
regions on the Oregon coast, near the Otter Rock MR (central) and the
Redfish Rocks MR (southern) with a site inside of the reserve and a
comparison site outside of the reserve from 2011 to the present. These
are monitored regularly (approximately every 2 weeks) during the
settlement season (April - September) and YOY are collected for genetic
identification and measured. Settlement rate of YOY Yellowtail Rockfish
was provided by OSU for each site within each region. Paired temperature
at depth data was provided by ODFW MR Ecological Monitoring team for
this assessment. Daily mean temperature data was provided for three
depth strata (1m, 7.5m, and 15m) for each site within each region.

Oceanographic sampling by the ODFW MR Ecological Monitoring team has not
been able to be done simultaneously in both reserves at each mooring
site at all depths due to a lack of equipment. However, for time periods
when there was matched data, temperature was highly correlated across
depths (Pearson's correlation coefficient \textgreater{} 0.90) and
between sites within each region (Pearson's correlation coefficients
\textgreater0.98). In order to calculate an index of daily water column
temperature that was continuous enough to be combined with settlement
rate data, temperature data was standardized within year and depth. For
periods with multiple observations, the mean was taken in order to
generate a single continuous temperature time series. Mean SMURF
deployment lasted 15.5 days. In order to summarize temperature in an
ecologically meaningful way relative to the SMURF sampling design, a
16-day rolling mean of temperature and cumulative degree days over
16-day periods were calculated. These data were matched with settlement
rate data such that the mean temperature or the cumulative degree days
during the 16-day period that the SMURF was deployed was used.

Covariates evaluated for were year, month, region (Redfish Rocks or
Otter Rock), temperature, and site (within marine reserve or nearby
comparison site). Preliminary model runs indicated a consistent lack of
convergence and additional filters were applied to address this,
including limiting the data to 2014 - 2024 and to the peak months of
settlement for yellowtail (May - July). Month was not included in models
that included temperature as both covariates were used to describe
seasonal variation in settlement rate. Site was not a significant
covariate in this model but this was not unexpected, as the presence of
a reserve would not be anticipated to impact juvenile settlement rates.
Models were fit to the settlement rate data (YOY fish per day) using
sdmTMB R package (Version 0.6.0). Both negative binomial and tweedie
distributions were evaluated. The model that was selected based on fit
(TABLE X) and expert opinion from OSU and ODFW staff. The final model
contained year, region, and temperature summarized as cumulative degree
days 16-days prior to SMURF recovery using a negative binomial
distribution. Acceptable model convergence and other diagnostic criteria
for the final index were achieved (FIGURE - qqplot). The index of YOY
abundance and associated standard errors are shown in Figure/Table Y.

\subsection{Biological Parameters}\label{biological-parameters}

\subsubsection{Natural Mortality}\label{natural-mortality}

\subsubsection{Weight-at-length}\label{weight-at-length}

\subsubsection{Maturity}\label{maturity}

We used a total of 292 individual histological samples of aged female
yellowtail rockfish to estimate maturity for the assessment. These
samples were all collected north of 40.167; this latitude filter
excluded 5 additional samples collected in the south, but the inclusion
or exclusion of these samples did not change our results. The 292
samples were collected over the period 2016---2023, though more samples
were collected earlier in these years (n = 111 in 2016, 52 in 2017, 31
in 2018, 17 in 2021, 9 in 2022, 13 in 2023). Previous assessments of
yellowtail estimated length-based maturity (L50 = 42.49cm in 2017
assessment); however, we switched to an age based model for the current
assessment. For many species, energy is reallocated toward maturation
from growth, and as a result growth rates slow during the juvenile to
adult transition period. Thus, length at 50\% maturity will represent a
range of ages, providing a less accurate understanding of the spawning
population. We treated maturity as a binomial response, and considered a
variety of models with temporal and spatial covariates, using a logit
link and generalized linear mixed model framework, implemented the R
package sdmTMB (\citeproc{ref-Anderson:2024:SRP}{Anderson et al. 2024}).
Briefly, we considered models that included (1) temporal year effects
(either estimated as a random walk intercept, or smooth term), (2)
spatial random fields (using a mesh cutoff distance of 50km), and (3)
spatially varying coefficients of age, following the model adopted by
Grandin et al. (\citeproc{ref-grandin_status_2024}{2024}). Models that
converged were compared by examining QQ plots, AUC metrics, and AIC
scores. Likely because of the uneven temporal distribution of sampling,
and general sparsity, we did not find support for including temporal or
spatial effects, and decided on the simpler null model (equivalent to a
logistic regression). For the age-based model, we estimated an intercept
of -6.70 (SE = 0.99) and slope of 0.67 (SE = 0.10), equivalent to an A50
of 10.0 years. For a more direct comparison to the previous assessment,
we used these same 292 samples to fit an equivalent length -- based
model, which resulted in an estimated L50 = 42.5 cm.

\subsubsection{Oceanographic Index}\label{oceanographic-index}

Over the past several years, progress has been made in understanding how
oceanographic conditions drive recruitment of groundfish species in the
California Current Ecosystem across lifestages including petrale sole,
sablefish and hake. Recent increases in capacity supported by the
Climate, Ecosystem, and Fisheries Initiative provided the ability to
build on these previous lines of research and examine the relationship
between northern Yellowtail rockfish recruitment and oceanographic
drivers based on model output from Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis
(GLORYS) from \href{https://marine.copernicus.eu/}{Copernicus Marine
Environment Monitoring Service} (CMEMS) and Regional Ocean Modeling
System (ROMS) model for the California Current Ecosystem (Neveu et
al.~2016). The results suggest that GLORYS and ROMS output may allow for
better model precision and near-term forecasting. This approach builds
on previous research (Tolimieri et al.~2020, Haltuch et al.~2020,
Vestfals et al.~2023) and assessments (Taylor et al.~2023, Johnson et
al.~2023) by applying similar techniques to establish oceanographic
relationships and develop an oceanographic index based on a conceptual
life history model for yellowtail rockfish (Darby et al.~in prep).
GLORYS also provides a temporally robust time series and is not
susceptible to discontinuities identified in the 2023 petrale sole
assessment. Appendix A of this report describes the most recent efforts
in developing a new environmental index of northern Yellowtail
recruitment based on GLORYS products. The final selected model included
the date of spring transition from the Coastal Upwelling Transport
Index, degree days (represent temperature exposure) during egg
fertilization and development, long-shore transport during the pelagic
juvenile lifestage, and El Nino conditions during the pelagic juvenile
lifestage. The oceanographic model was fit using the recruitment
deviations (1994 - 2019) from the base model and used to predict log
recruitment deviations 5 years ahead, 2020 - 2024, using oceanographic
conditions.
