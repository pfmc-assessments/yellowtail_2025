Yellowtail rockfish, *Sebastes flavidus*, occur off the West Coast of the United States from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.  yellowtail is a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from Central California to British Columbia [@Love2011].  Because it is an aggregating midwater species it is usually caught in the commercial midwater trawl fishery. In Central California there is a large recreational fishery as well. The center of yellowtail rockfish abundance is from southern Oregon through British Columbia [@Fraidenburg1980]. We briefly summarize yellowtail rockfish life history, fisheries, assessment and management here, but in-depth, extensive background information on yellowtail rockfish and other managed species is available in @PFMC2024.  

Genetic evidence indicates that there are two stocks of yellowtail rockfish, with a genetic line at Cape Mendocino, California, roughly $40^\circ 10^\prime$ North Latitude [@Hess2011]. This study of 1013 fish from 21 sites along the West Coast from Mexico through Alaska examined two datasets, one of mitochondrial DNA, and one of nuclear DNA microsattelite loci. Findings in both datasets agreed, and also concur with the findings of Field and Ralston [-@Field2005] who looked at differences in recruitment trends related to physical forcing and coherence along the coast, and found the greatest differences among the U.S. and Canadian stocks to be defined by Cape Mendocino. Neither the genetic study nor the oceanographic studies definitively identify mechanisms of stock isolation; however, they suggest that a combination of physical forcing due to offshore advection and differences in available habitat across Cape Mendocino may together account for the differences observed.

The current assessment is for the northern stock only. A map showing the scope of the current assessment and depicting boundaries for the two west coast stocks is provided in @fig-assessregionmap. The 2017 yellowtail rockfish assessment included the first full length and age integrated assessment model south of Cape Mendocino. However, it was withdrawn by the assessment team and has not been used in management.

## Life History
<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

Rockfish are in general long-lived and slow-growing; however, yellowtail rockfish have a high growth rate relative to other rockfish species, reaching a maximum size of about 55 cm in approximately 15 years [@Tagart1991]. Yellowtail are reported to live at least 64 years [@Love2011], but no fish that old occur in data available for this assessment (the 95th percentile of age is 35 years for females and 45 years for males).  The maximum age plausibly observed in the data is 60. There were additional data we considered to be outliers and possibly erroneous, including three fish in the commercial data reported to be 70, 99, and 101.

Yellowtail rockfish are among those that are fertilized internally and release live young.  Spawning aggregations occur in the fall, and parturition in the winter and spring (January-May) [@Eldridge1991]. Young-of-the-year recruit to nearshore waters from April through August, migrating to deeper water in the fall. Preferred habitat is the midwater over reefs and boulder fields. Young-of-the-year yellowtail rockfish settle to nearshore areas, and are known to utilize kelp bed habitat [@Love2011]. @laidig2023distribution note that young yellowtail are found in kelp beds but also in slightly deeper waters seaward of kelp beds.   

Yellowtail rockfish are extremely motile, and make rapid and frequent ascents and descents of 40 meters; they also exhibit strong homing tendencies [@Love2011].  They are able to quickly release gas from their swim bladders, perhaps making them less susceptible to barotrauma than similar species [@Eldridge1991].  

## Ecosystem considerations
<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stockâ€™s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

A number of studies correlate environmental conditions to pelagic juvenile abundance and juvenile recruitment of rockfishes, including yellowtail rockfish. Year-class strength is particularly impacted during the early larval phase, and annual pelagic juvenile abundance is correlated with physical conditions, especially upwelling strength along the coast [e.g., @Field2005; @Laidig2007; @Laidig2010; @Ralston2013]. Rockfish in general are sensitive to the strength and timing of the upwelling cycle in the Eastern Pacific, which affects where pelagic juveniles settle, and impacts the availability of the zooplankton which the young require.

Yellowtail rockfish feed mainly on pelagic animals, but are opportunistic, occasionally eating benthic animals as well. Large juveniles and adults eat fish (small Pacific whiting, Pacific herring, smelt, anchovies, lanternfishes, and others), along with squid, krill, and other planktonic organisms. @Wippel2017 summarized diet data for yellowtail rockfish based on 1069 stomachs collected from 1982 - 1999. Ranked from most to least common, the dominant prey were *euphasiids* (krill), juvenile hake, gelatinous zooplankton (predominantly salps and ctenophores) and herring. For juvenile yellowtail, the dominant prey taxa were *euphasiids* and mesozooplankton such as copepods.

Yellowtail rockfish are prey for Chinook salmon, lingcod, cormorants, pigeon guillemots and rhinoceros auklets [@Love2011]. Based on Ecopath foodweb modeling, seven  predators are identified as high sources of predation mortality: California sea lions, lingcod, porpoises, fur seals, harbor seals, sablefish, and skates [@koehn2016]. 

## Fishery description
<!-- Important features of current fishery and relevant history of fishery.  -->

The rockfish fishery off the U.S. Pacific coast first developed off California in the late 19th century as a hook-and-line fishery [@Love2002]. The first record of yellowtail in a catch reconstruction is commercial catch in Washington in 1889; Oregon has a record shortly thereafter in 1892. Records for recreational fishing begin in 1928. The rockfish trawl fishery was established in the early 1940s, when the United States became involved in World War II and wartime shortage of red meat created an increased demand for other sources of protein [@Alverson1964; @Harry1961; @Miller2014]. During the early development period of the rockfish fishery there was little attention paid to quantifying the species composition of the landings. Although we know yellowtail rockfish were caught in the 1940s and 50s, we have limited quantitative knowledge of the proportion of their contribution to the total landings. In the early 1960s, coastal states began to report landings by species [@Niska1976; @TagartKimura1982]. 

In 1977, the U.S. extended fisheries jurisdiction to 200 nautical miles offshore. Yellowtail rockfish off Oregon and Washington were an important target of the expanding fishery during this time. In the 1980s and 1990s, a directed midwater trawl fishery developed that targeted yellowtail rockfish, among several other rockfish species. New technology extended fishing operations into previously unfished areas and enabled vessels to follow widow rockfish concentrations throughout the year [@Quirollo1987; @Demory1987]. As a midwater species, it was also commonly caught as bycatch in the hake fishery.

Canary and widow rockfish, two common co-occurring species [@Tagart1988; @Rogers1992] were both declared overfished during the West Coast groundfish collapse around 2000. This substantially altered fishing opportunities for yellowtail. In order to achieve the necessary reduction in the catch of canary rockfish, widow rockfish, and other overfished species, stringent management measures were adopted that limited harvest of yellowtail rockfish.

Canary and widow rockfish were declared rebuilt in 2015 [@thorson_status_2015; @hicks_status_2015], and commercial and recreational yellowtail catch increased substantially beginning when those assessments were first used for harvest specifications in 2017. 

## Management History
<!---
Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, catch rates, or discards). 
--->

Yellowtail rockfish are currently managed with stock-specific harvest specifications north of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude, and as part of the Southern Shelf rockfish complex south of $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. latitude.

Prior to 1983, only market forces constrained the domestic trawl fishery for yellowtail rockfish. In 1983, U.S. managers imposed the first trip limit on landings from the *Sebastes* complex (a collection of rockfish species that included yellowtail rockfish) and set a target quota for the complex. By September 1983, harvest was approaching the quota in the Columbia and Vancouver areas. Managers responded by reducing trip limits and frequency. Thus began a tumultuous management history for *Sebastes* complex species and yellowtail rockfish, in particular [@Tagart2000]. The \gls{pfmc} continued to use trip limit and frequency regulations in an attempt to spread the harvest throughout the calendar year, reduce bycatch in the directed fishery, and limit regulation-induced discard. In-season adjustments (usually reductions) to trip limits occurred often [@Tagart2000]. Increasing harvest rates and declining abundance of coastal groundfish species resulted in increasingly smaller trip limits. 

A number of major management changes affecting yellowtail rockfish occurred in 2000. First, canary rockfish, a major co-occurring species, was determined to be overfished. In order to achieve the necessary reduction in the canary rockfish catch, the \gls{pfmc} adopted stringent management measures that limited harvest of canary rockfish and their co-occurring species such as yellowtail. Second, shelf rockfish species could no longer be retained by vessels using bottom trawl footropes with a diameter greater than 8 inches. The use of small footrope gear increases the risk of gear loss in rocky areas. This restriction was intended to provide an incentive for fishers to avoid high-relief, rocky habitat, thus reducing the exposure of many depleted species to trawling. This reinforced reductions in landing limits for most shelf rockfish species. Third, the \gls{pfmc} adopted a new partitioning of rockfish species. Yellowtail rockfish was assigned to the minor shelf rockfish group south of Cape Mendocino, and was managed as a single species in the North.

Since September 2002, trawl and non-trawl Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs, areas known to be critical habitat) have been closed to fishing. Alongside these closures, limits on landings were put in place that were designed so as to accommodate incidental bycatch only. These eliminated directed midwater fishing opportunities for yellowtail rockfish in non-tribal trawl fisheries and increased discard rates (which had historically been low). A somewhat greater opportunity to target yellowtail rockfish in the trawl fishery became available in 2011 under the trawl rationalization program. However, quotas for widow and canary rockfish generally constrained targeting of yellowtail rockfish. 


This changed with the rebuilding declaration of both canary and widow rockfish, with increases in catch limits beginning in 2017. Additionally, new exempted fishing permits for midwater trawl gear occurred in 2017-2018 and a number of updates to regulations around trawl and non-trawl RCAs from 2019-2024 all further expanded opportunities to fish in abundant yellowtail habitat.

While recreational fisheries have caught yellowtail for many years, recent exempted fishing permits for Holloway longleader gear in Oregon and limited bag limits for black rockfish in Washington have pushed recreational fisheries farther offshore and increased the sizes and amount of yellowtail caught in the recreational sector.  

## Management performance

Over the past decade, catch has remained substantially below ACL (Table \ref{tbl-es-management}). Total catch (including landings and discards) doubled between 2016 and 2017 but still remained less than 50% of the \gls{acl}. Total catch has remained well below the management limits and harvest specifications in recent years (Table \ref{tbl-es-management})

## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Councilâ€™s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->

Yellowtail rockfish are a target species in Canada with catches between 4000-6000 mt since the late 1980s. It has the second largest single-species Total Allowable Catch (TAC) among rockfish species under quota management for the Canadian Pacific Coast. In Canada it is caught in similar amounts by bottom and midwater trawl gear. A 2015 stock assessment conducted by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada found the stock to be at 50\% of unfished spawning biomass, in the "healthy" range [@DFO2015]. 

A new Canadian assessment was reviewed in October 2024 but has not yet been published. Like the current assessment, this model also used stock synthesis, but was purely age-based with an empirical weight-at-age matrix used instead of parametric growth. Management quantities were also based on posterior medians rather than maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) estimates. However, for purposes of comparison with the current base model, the MLE estimates from model files available [online](https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-synth/blob/master/PBSsynth/inst/input/2024/YTR) were used to compare results with the current base model. The time series of fraction of unfished spawning output is similar as are the recruitment deviations (@fig-can-timeseries) suggesting that recruitment is linked between the two regions, which is not surprising given the lack of a biogeographic boundary. The 1990, 2000, and 2008 cohorts are some of the largest in both models (@fig-can-recdevs).

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center assesses yellowtail rockfish as one of approximately 25 non-target rockfish species in the "Other rockfish" complex in the Gulf of Alaska. The complex is assessed biennially to coincide with the availability of new trawl survey biomass estimates in odd-numbered years. The last operational assessment was conducted in 2023 with an update in 2024. There was no evidence to suggest that overfishing is occurring for the complex. Total catch in 2023 was 1,079 t was lower than the Gulf-wide \gls{ofl} and \gls{abc} of 4,054 t and 3,774 t, respectively [@Omori2023; @Omori2024].
