Yellowtail Rockfish, *Sebastes flavidus*, occur off the West Coast of the United States from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.  Yellowtail is a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from Central California to British Columbia [@Love2011].  Because it is an aggregating, midwater species it is usually caught in the commercial midwater trawl fishery. In California there is a large recreational fishery as well. The center of Yellowtail Rockfish abundance is from southern Oregon through British Columbia [@Fraidenburg1980].  Yellowtail Rockfish are colloquially known as "greenies", although *flavidus* is Latin for "yellow" [@Love2011].  We briefly summarize Yellowtail Rockfish life history, fisheries, assessment and management here, but in-depth, extensive background information on Yellowtail Rockfish and other managed species is available at [@PFMC2016].  

A number of studies correlate environmental conditions to pelagic juvenile abundance and juvenile recruitment of rockfishes, including Yellowtail Rockfish. Year-class strength is particularly impacted during the early larval phase, and annual pelagic juvenile abundance is correlated with physical conditions, especially upwelling strength along the coast (e.g., [@Field2005], [@Laidig2007], [@Laidig2010], [@Ralston2013]).

A recent genetic study [@Hess2011] indicates that there are in fact two stocks of Yellowtail Rockfish, with a genetic cline at Cape Mendocino, California, roughly $40^\circ 10^\prime$ North Latitude.  This study of 1013 fish from 21 sites along the West Coast from Mexico through Alaska examined two datasets, one of mitochondrial DNA, and one of nuclear DNA microsattelite loci.  Findings in both datasets agreed, and also concur with the findings of Field and Ralston [@Field2005] who looked at differences in recruitment trends related to physical forcing and coherence along the coast, and found the greatest differences among the U.S. and Canadian stocks to be defined by Cape Mendocino.  Neither the genetic study nor the oceanographic studies definitively identify mechanisms of stock isolation, however they suggest that a combination of physical forcing due to offshore advection and differences in available habitat across Cape Mendocino may together account for the differences observed.

The species has never had a full length and age integrated assessment south of Cape Mendocino, mainly due to a lack of fishery-independent data; this assessment represents an initial attempt to do so.

A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or data collection strata is provided in Figure \ref{fig:assess_region_map}.

## Life History

<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

## Management History

<!---
Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, catch rates, or discards).

## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->

## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Council’s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->
