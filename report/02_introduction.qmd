Yellowtail Rockfish, *Sebastes flavidus*, occur off the West Coast of the United States from Baja California to the Aleutian Islands.  Yellowtail is a major commercial species, captured mostly in trawls from Central California to British Columbia [@Love2011].  Because it is an aggregating, midwater species it is usually caught in the commercial midwater trawl fishery. In California there is a large recreational fishery as well. The center of Yellowtail Rockfish abundance is from southern Oregon through British Columbia [@Fraidenburg1980]. We briefly summarize Yellowtail Rockfish life history, fisheries, assessment and management here, but in-depth, extensive background information on Yellowtail Rockfish and other managed species is available at [@PFMC2024].  

A previous genetic study [@Hess2011] indicates that there are in fact two stocks of Yellowtail Rockfish, with a genetic line at Cape Mendocino, California, roughly $40^\circ 10^\prime$ North Latitude.  This study of 1013 fish from 21 sites along the West Coast from Mexico through Alaska examined two datasets, one of mitochondrial DNA, and one of nuclear DNA microsattelite loci. Findings in both datasets agreed, and also concur with the findings of Field and Ralston [@Field2005] who looked at differences in recruitment trends related to physical forcing and coherence along the coast, and found the greatest differences among the U.S. and Canadian stocks to be defined by Cape Mendocino. Neither the genetic study nor the oceanographic studies definitively identify mechanisms of stock isolation, however they suggest that a combination of physical forcing due to offshore advection and differences in available habitat across Cape Mendocino may together account for the differences observed.

A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or data collection strata is provided in @fig-assessregionmap. The 2017 Yellowtail Rockfish assessment was the first full length and age integrated assessment south of Cape Mendocino. Here we assess only the northern stock in @fig-assessregionmap.

## Life History

<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

Rockfish are in general long-lived and slow-growing, however Yellowtail Rockfish have a high growth rate relative to other rockfish species, reaching a maximum size of about 55 cm in approximately 15 years [@Tagart1991].  Yellowtail are reported to live at least 64 years [@Love2011], however no fish that old occur in data available for this assessment (the 95th percentile of age is 35 years for females and 45 years for males).  The maximum age plausibly observed  is 60. There were data we considered to be outliers, for example, three fish in the PacFIN data were reported to be 70, 99, and 101.

Yellowtail Rockfish are among those that are fertilized internally and release live young.  Spawning aggregations occur in the fall, and parturition in the winter and spring (January-May) [@Eldridge1991].  Young-of-the-year recruit to nearshore waters from April through August, migrating to deeper water in the fall.  Preferred habitat is the midwater over reefs and boulder fields. Young of the year yellowtail rockfish settle to nearshore areas, and are known to utilize kelp bed habitat [@Love2011]. @laidig2023distribution note that young yellowtail are found in kelp beds but also in slightly deeper waters seaward of kelp beds.   

Yellowtail Rockfish are extremely motile, and make rapid and frequent ascents and descents of 40 meters; they also exhibit strong homing tendencies [@Love2011].  They are able to quickly release gas from their swim bladders, perhaps making them less susceptible to barotrauma than similar species [@Eldridge1991].  

Literature values for von Bertallanfy parameters are $L_\infty = 52.2, k = 0.17, t_0 = -0.75$ for females, $L_\infty = 47.6, k=0.19, t_0 = -1.69$ for males.  Length-Weight parameters are $W = 0.0287L^{2.822}$ for females, $W = 0.0359L^{2.745}$ for males [@Love2011].  See Section \ref{bio-params} for a discussion of the new analysis of the weight-length relationship.  Fecundity is represented in the models as:  $1.1185^{-11}W^{4.59}$.  This is a rescaling of the values provided in [@Dick2017].

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

A number of studies correlate environmental conditions to pelagic juvenile abundance and juvenile recruitment of rockfishes, including Yellowtail Rockfish. Year-class strength is particularly impacted during the early larval phase, and annual pelagic juvenile abundance is correlated with physical conditions, especially upwelling strength along the coast (e.g., @Field2005; @Laidig2007; @Laidig2010; @Ralston2013). Rockfish in general are sensitive to the strength and timing of the upwelling cycle in the Eastern Pacific, which affects where pelagic juveniles settle, and impacts the availability of the zooplankton which the young require.

Yellowtail Rockfish feed mainly on pelagic animals, but are opportunistic, occasionally eating benthic animals as well. Large juveniles and adults eat fish (small Pacific Whiting, Pacific Herring, smelt, anchovies, lanternfishes, and others), along with squid, krill, and other planktonic organisms. @Wippel2017 summarized diet data for Yellowtail Rockfish based on 1069 stomachs collected from 1982 - 1999. Ranked from most to least common, the dominant pre were *euphasiids* (krill), juvenile hake, gelatinous zooplankton (predominantly salps and ctenophores) and herring. For juvenile yellowtail, the dominant prey taxa were *euphasiids* and mesozooplankton such as copepods.

Yellowtail Rockfish are prey for Chinook Salmon, Lingcod, Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots and Rhinoceros Auklets [@Love2011]. Based on Ecopath foodweb modeling, seven  predators are identified as high sources of predation mortality: California sea lions, lingcod, porpoises, fur seals, harbor seals, sablefish and skates.

## Management History

<!---
Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, catch rates, or discards). 
--->

Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) have been closed to fishing since 2002.  Following that closure, Yellowtail Rockfish are among the many species that have been seen to increase in both abundance and in average size in Central California  [@Marks2015].
## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->

## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Council’s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->
