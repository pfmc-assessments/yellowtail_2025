Ecosystem and environmental conditions,Assessment data inputs,Assessment model fits and structural uncertainty
• Recruitment: unfavorable to neutral conditions for recruitment,"• Catch reconstruction is reliable for a rockfish species, with some uncertainty in historical years when rockfish were not always sorted to species","• Well-informed sex-specific estimates of natural mortality, unfished recruitment, and growth"
• Habitat: Neutral,"• More age data than almost any other groundfish species. Covers shoreside, at-sea, and recreational sectors. Shoreside age data dating back to the 1970s. ",• Steepness fixed at meta-analysis prior. 
• Prey: Most available evidence suggests adequate forage for yellowtail in 2024 and recent years. Caveat: low krill in 2023 acoustic surveys. ,• Age data are generally fit well with simple selectivity assumptions. Some mild issues with commercial (shoreside) length data.,• Good fits to abundant composition data with fairly simple selectivity assumptions and fleet structure
• Predators: no trend in abundance for 6 of 7 predators in the last 5 yrs ,• Species-specific maturity and fecundity; maturity data collected over the last ~10 years,"• Model generally misses an increase in the WCGBTS from 2014-2019. Non-stationary catchability seems more likely than an incorrect modeled population trajectory, given similar increases seen during this time for all midwater rockfish. "
"• Competitors: Some potential for hake competition for krill, but highly uncertain. ",• Bottom trawl survey may not be reliable way to generate index for midwater rockfish,"• Highly numerically stable model, MCMC posteriors are similar to assumption of asymptotic normality"
,• New exploration of early life history and hook and line surveys,• Most sensitivity model runs are well within the asymptotic confidence interval of the base model
,"• Generally a target species with most catch landed, only limited bycatch",
