• Recruitment: unfavorable to neutral conditions for recruitment,"• Catch reconstruction is reliable for a rockfish species, with some uncertainty in historical years when rockfish were not always sorted to species",WILL BE FILLED IN AFTER THE STAR PANEL
• Habitat: Neutral,"• More age data than almost any other groundfish species. Covers shoreside, at-sea, and recreational sectors. Shoreside age data dating back to the 1970s. ",
• Prey: Most available evidence suggests adequate forage for yellowtail in 2024 and recent years. Caveat: low krill in 2023 acoustic surveys. ,• Age data are generally fit well with simple selectivity assumptions. Some mild issues with commercial (shoreside) length data.,
• Predators: no trend in abundance for 6 of 7 predators in the last 5 yrs ,• Species-specific maturity and fecundity; maturity data collected over the last ~10 years,
"• Competitors: Some potential for hake competition for krill, but highly uncertain. ",• Bottom trawl survey may not be reliable way to generate index for midwater rockfish,
,• New exploration of early life history and hook and line surveys,
,"• Generally a target species with most catch landed, only limited bycatch",
