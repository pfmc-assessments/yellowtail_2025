Recruitment / Age-0 abundance index,Benefits,Drawbacks
Oceanographic Index,• Includes oceanographic conditions identified by literature and expert opinion,• Indirect observation of recruitment 
,• Potential to use forecasts in future assessments,• Index development procedures make balancing model convergence and potential bias challenging
,,• Good practices for including recruitment deviation indices in stock synthesis models are not yet established
OCNMS Nearshore Rockfish,• Direct observations of YOY in region where juveniles are highly abundant,"• Identified as a complex with Black Rockfish, which make up most observations"
,,• Limited temporal scope throughout the settlement season
,,• Data only available since 2015
SMURF Juvenile Survey,• Direct observations of YOY settlement rate in region where juveniles are highly abundant,• Limited spatial scope 
,• Identified at the species level,• Data only available since 2014
,• Repeat sampling throughout the settlement season,
,• Environmentally informed such that settlement rate is associated with temperature exposure,
,• Collaboratively developed with agency and university partners,
Yellowtail RREAS Coastwide,• Long time series since 2001,• Less synchronous with other juvenile indices
,,• Variable sampling effort/spatial domain focused south of stock
,,• Poorly correlated with well-informed estimates of recruitment
Northern YOY Rockfish,• Synchrony with other indices,• Not taxonomically specific to yellowtail
