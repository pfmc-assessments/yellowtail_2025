## Fishery-dependent data

<!-- Commercial fisheries landings by state, year, and gear (PacFIN is the standard source for recent domestic commercial landings), historical catch estimates, discards, recreational fisheries catches, foreign removals; sample size information for length- and age-composition data by state, year and gear, including both the number of trips and fish sampled. Description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information by survey and year. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction. -->

Fishery-dependent data were split into three fleets: a shoreside commercial fleet ("Commercial"), an at-sea commercial fleet ("At-sea"), and a recreational fleet ("Recreational"). The vast majority of catches across all years has come from trawl gear in the shoreside commercial sector.

### Landings

#### Commercial

Commercial landings ultimately came from a mix of \gls{pacfin} and state reconstructions.

\Gls{wdfw} provided a reconstruction from 1889 to 1980. From 1981 to 2000, a separate \gls{wdfw} reconstruction was used that apportioned out more unidentified rockfish in fish tickets to the species level than the default species allocation algorithms in \gls{pacfin}. No formal citation is available for either of these reconstructions. Landings from 2001 to 2024 came from \gls{pacfin} (pulled March 10, 2025).

In Oregon, historical commercial landings from 1892 to 1986 were provided by ODFW (@karnowski_historical_2014).  Landings from 1987 – 1999 were compiled from a combination of PacFIN and a separate ODFW reconstruction that delineated species-specific landings in the unspecified categories on PacFIN [e.g. URCK and POP1, @ODFW_URCK_POP_recon]. Yellowtail rockfish landings from this reconstruction were substituted for the URCK and POP1 landings available from PacFIN and added to PacFIN landings from other categories for a complete time series during this time period. Commercial landings from 2000 – 2024 are available on \gls{pacfin}. 

California commercial landings came from the reconstruction in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] and an additional reconstruction of catches off of the coast of Oregon landed into California during that time (1916-1968), \gls{calcom} (1969-1980), and \gls{pacfin} (1981-2024, pulled March 10, 2025). \Gls{calcom} and \gls{pacfin} data in California were filtered to include only the Eureka and Crescent City port area groups (equivalent to Humboldt and Del Norte counties) to approximate landings north of $40^{\circ} 10'$. While Shelter Cove is in Humboldt county but south of $40^{\circ} 10'$, and this approach assigns catch based on port of landing rather than geographic location of catch, this is the same approach used in the 2017 assessment. In conversations with \gls{cdfw}, it was determined to be the best way to identify catches for the northern stock given the available data.

In the Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] reconstruction, the northernmost region (region 2) includes Crescent City, Eureka *and* Fort Bragg port area groups. Catch in the Crescent City and Eureka port area groups is estimated based on the fraction of catch in Crescent City and Eureka divided by catch in all of region 2 during the first five years of \gls{calcom} (1969-1973). The vast majority (96%) of the catch is in the two northern port areas. All supplementary catches in the Ralston reconstruction caught off the coast of Oregon, but landed into California are included.

Foreign commercial landings caught in U.S. waters that occurred prior to closure of the EEZ are not included in any state historical reconstruction. Estimates of these landings were added to domestic commercial catches for 1966-1976 [@rogers_species_2003]. Note that these catches were missing from the 2017 assessment. 

#### At-sea

At-sea catches were provided by Vanessa Tuttle (\gls{nwfsc}) on November 7, 2024 for the years 1976-2023, and on February 11, 2025 for 2024.

#### Recreational

Recreational landings came from a mix of \gls{recfin} and state reconstructions. They are assumed to include both retained and released fish.

For Washington, a historical reconstruction (1967 and 1975-1989) and \gls{osp} estimates (1990-2024) were downloaded from \gls{recfin} (pulled November 7, 2024 and February 13, 2025, respectively). Additional catches in 1968-1970, 1972, and 1973 were provided directly by \gls{wdfw} on February 18, 2025. Historical data were filtered to areas 1-4. For \gls{osp} data, we used data in table CTE501 on \gls{recfin}, filtering out catches in Canada and in the Sekiu and Pillar Point catch area (the latter of which lies in Puget Sound).

Washington's historical recreational catches are only available in numbers. Unlike in the 2017 assessment, we converted these these catches to weights before entering them into the model in order to facilitate a single recreational fleet. This seemed appropriate given that recreational catches across all three states represent a relatively small fraction of total fishing mortality (Fig. X). To do this, we calculated average length of samples collected prior to 1990 in the WA Sport Biodata. This included 48 samples from 1979, 1981, and 1982. The next available samples were in 1995. We used an unsexed length-weight relationship calculated from survey data. Catch estimates in 1971 and 1974 were not available, so were calculated as the average of the two previous and two subsequent years.

For Oregon, a historical reconstruction provided numbers of fish from 1979-2000 (@Whitman_2024), which were converted to biomass using biological samples from \gls{mrfss} (pers. comm. A. Whitman, ODFW).  These landings in biomass were provided by ODFW and do not include an estimate of discarded fish. Bag limits in the recreational fishery during this time period (prior to 2001) are generally liberal and ODFW staff recommended that no additional mortality of discarded fish be included prior to 2001. Recreational landings for Oregon from 2001-2024 are available from \gls{recfin}.  

California recreational catches came from Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] (1928-1980), as well as \gls{mrfss} (1981-2004) and \gls{crfs} (2005-2024) estimates downloaded from \gls{recfin} (downloaded November 12, 2024 and February 21, 2025, respectively). For \gls{crfs}, only catches in the Redwoods district were considered to be part of the northern stock. Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] and \gls{mrfss} aggregate catches into Northern and and Southern California. \Gls{mrfss} excluded San Luis Obispo county from Northern California from 1980-1989 only. San Luis Obispo is included in Northern California Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] and later years of \gls{mrfss}. Albin et al. [-@albin1993] estimated recreational catches in California by county from San Luis Obispo north from 1981-1986. We calculated 1) the ratio of catches in Albin et al. [-@albin1993] in Del Norte and Humboldt counties divided by the catch in *all* counties, 2) the ratio of catches in Albin et al. [-@albin1993] in Del Norte and Humboldt counties divided by the catch in all counties *except* San Luis Obispo, and 3) the ratio of total catch in \gls{crfs} in the Redwoods district divided by total catch in the Northern California sub-region from 2005-2010. Then, to calculate catches north of $40^{\circ}10'$, we multiplied total Northern California catches in Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] by ratio (1). From 1981-1989, we multiplied Northern California catches in \gls{mrfss} by ratio (2). From 1993-2004 we multiplied Northern California catches in \gls{mrfss} by a weighted average of ratios (1) and (3). Weights were the inverse of time to the last year in Albin et al. [-@albin1993] and the first year of \gls{crfs}. No \gls{mrfss} estimates are available from 1990-1992. For this time period, we interpolated between the average catches from 1987-1989 and 1993-1995.

Recreational biological samples were available from the three coastal states covering the years 1980--2024 (Table \ref{tbl-rec-bio}). There were 64,637 length samples, of which 71% was from Oregon, 26% from Washington, and 3% from California (North of $40^{\circ} 10'$). There were 9,205 age samples, 100% of which were from Washington.

### Abundance indices

#### Commercial observer and electronic monitoring index

Yellowtail rockfish are a midwater rockfish often found slightly above the seafloor, and therefore standard bottom trawl surveys may not effectively measure changes in relative abundance. The commercial fishery often catches them using midwater trawl gear. Catch share vessels in the trawl fishery have had 100% observer or electronic monitoring (EM) coverage since 2012. We generated a fishery-dependent observer index using data from the \gls{wcgop}, filtered to trips that used midwater gear, caught yellowtail, widow, or canary rockfish (i.e., the main midwater rockfish species), and for which >50% of the catch was rockfish (i.e., not shoreside hake trips, where vessels may be actively avoiding rockfish). The data covered 2012-2023 and included 3,962 tows on 878 unique trips by 46 different vessels; 69.7% of tows contained Yellowtail. Data from 2024 was not available by the data deadline. We used \gls{sdmtmb} to fit a delta-lognormal model [@Anderson_2024_SRP] to the catch per unit effort (metric tons caught per hour towed). In addition to fixed effects for each year, we included a spline term for standardized depth, a cyclic spline for month (i.e., forces a smooth transition from December to January), a fixed effect for observer versus EM data, a random effect for vessel ID, and a fixed effect for whether the tow was conducted north or south of the mouth of the Columbia River. During the pre-assessment workshop, fishermen reported catches of Yellowtail are consistently much higher north of the Columbia River, which is corroborated in the survey data (Fig. X). We did not fit a full spatiotemporal model because tow locations are non-random, which can lead to bias [@conn2017confronting]. The main purpose of this index was to explore whether fishery catch rates using midwater gear are similar to or different from a fishery-independent bottom trawl survey index. However, we did conduct a sensitivity to the inclusion of the index in the assessment model (CITE SENSITIVITIES SECTION).

#### Oregon ORBS Dockside Index (2001 - 2024)

Trip-level catch-per-unit-effort data from ORBS dockside sampling was obtained from ODFW. To mitigate the confounding of hourly effort associated with these trips with travel, the travel time was subtracted from the hours fished. Travel time was stratified by boat type (charter and private) and was calculated as boat type-specific speeds (13 mph for charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips) multiplied by twice the distance between the port of origin and the reef that was fished. CPUE, expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated by multiplying the number of anglers and the adjusted travel time. The database contains information on catch by species (number of retained fish), effort (angler hours), sample location (port where data were collected), date, bag limits and other relevant regulations, boat type (charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom associated fish).

The unfiltered data set contained 456,172 trips from 2001 - 2024. Multiple standardized filters are applied to ORBS trip-level data to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters include trips with incorrect interview times, which impact calculation of effort, unreasonably long or short trips, and retaining only bottomfish target trips. Further filters were utilized for fishing closures (i.e. temporal or spatial closures) and catches exceeding bag limits, which would presumably impact catch rates. Trips from several ports with extremely small sample sizes (\<1% of total trips) were also excluded and finally, trips that met criteria for irrational effort reporting (i.e., implausible values) or extreme catch rates were excluded as well. The final dataset included 137,502 trips @tbl-percent_pos.

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), boat type and the daily bag limit for Yellowtail Rockfish. Preliminary model explorations indicated that the daily bag limit covariate could not be combined with the open depth of the fishery due to changes in recreational fishing regulations over time. Prior to 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were included in the general marine bag limit. However, in 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were also included in a specialized longleader recreational bag limit where participants were required to be outside of 40fm. As a result, the bag limits were binned into a binary covariate for low (5 – 8 fish) and high (10 – 15fish) bag limits during the 2001 – 2024 time period. Negative binomial models were fit in sdmTMB (Version 0.6.0) to the trip-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). Tweedie distributions were also explored for selected models but generally did not improve model diagnostics. The final model selected includes year, month, port, open fishery depths, longleader trip and binned target bag limit covariates, which was the best fit model by AIC in this series (@tbl-orbs_mod_select). Acceptable diagnostics for the model were achieved (@fig-orbsqq) and the negative binomial distribution was preferred over the tweedie. The index of abundance is shown in @fig-orbsindex and @tbl-orbs_index.

## Fishery-independent data

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002]. Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continental shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated. The survey design changed slightly over time. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall. The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September. The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September. The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October. The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August. The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August. Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July. While the southern edge of the survey varied, the full latitudinal range of this assessment ($40^{\circ}10'$ to the Canadian border) was consistently surveyed.

Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted. The surveys from 1980 through 1992 covered a depth range of 55-366 m. From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m. In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

Index standardization followed a similar procedure to the \gls{s-wcgbt}.

<!-- We included the \gls{s-tri} as a single time series. To account for the changes in survey depths in 1995, we did not include hauls deeper than 350m, where canary rockfish are rarely found. Canary rockfish are not known to undertake seasonal migrations, so the change in survey timing should not be a major concern.  -->

### Combined OR-WA Hook and Line Survey

The Marine Reserves program at ODFW and the WDFW Coastal Marine Fish Science Unit execute standardized hook and line (or “rod and reel”) surveys that collect drift-level catch and biological data in rocky reef habitats on Washington’s nearshore waters and four marine reserve sites that span Oregon’s coastline. Both are loosely modeled after the California marine reserves survey. The WDFW rod and reel survey was assessed in an SSC methodology review in 2022, and both the ODFW and WDFW hook and line survey have separately been used in previous assessments, including most recently the 2023 Washington state black rockfish assessment [@Cope2023wa] and the 2023 Oregon black rockfish assessment [@Cope2023or]. Given the similarities in the survey protocols, these surveys were combined to produce a single index that spans the northern yellowtail rockfish stock assessment area.

The WDFW survey includes fixed standardized stations within three regional marine catch areas (i.e., MCA 2, MCA 3, and MCA 4) sampled with three replicate 8-minute drifts at each station. Details about the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology of the WDFW survey can be found in the Groundfish Subcommittee of the Scientific and Statistical Committee Visual-Hydroacoustic Survey Methodology Review and Hook-and-Line Survey Workshop from September 2022. The ODFW survey includes both marine reserves and nearby comparison areas. These comparison areas are pre-selected areas with similar bathymetry and habitat characteristics as the reserve but are open to fishing. Each reserve has at least one comparison area, but several have more than one that are monitored regularly along with the reserve. The index modeling procedure considered treatment (inside vs. outside a reserve) as a covariate. A 500-meter square grid overlaid on the area defines the sampling units or cells. Cells are randomly selected within a marine reserve or comparison area for each sampling event. The cells are considered analogous to stations in the WDFW survey. Unlike the WDFW survey, three replicate 15-minute drifts are executed in each cell. ODFW data are aggregated to the cell-day level and to the station level for the WDFW data and subsequently counts of fish per cell/station-day are used as the catch metric for CPUE. Sampling occurs in the spring and late summer/fall seasons for both surveys but given the focus of the WDFW survey on semi-pelagic rockfish species in the spring, the dataset was subset to spring months only (months March – June). This also alleviated differences in gear types between the two surveys. Throughout the history of these surveys, different gear types have been explored but generally, the gear types mirror recreational fishing gear. Gears from each survey were categorized in several ways to evaluate as a potential covariate in the index development. Primary gear types include diamond jigs, shrimp flies, mooching jigs and other jig or combination configurations with various sizes of attached weights. There were no significant differences in the overall length of the yellowtail rockfish encountered in each survey, despite the minor differences in gear (Figure XX). Finally, a covariate was created to evaluate regional spatial differences on a scale similar to the marine catch area-level in the WDFW survey. As a result, the two northern reserve areas (Cape Falcon and Cascade Head; “S5”) were combined into a single region, with Cape Perpetua (S6) and Redfish Rocks (S7) as separate Oregon regions. Each marine catch area in Washington was considered a single region (N2 – 4).

Covariates evaluated include year, month, region, treatment (reserve or comparison area), a binned average drift depth, and multiple different gear categorizations. These included two different categorizations (n = 5 or n = 3) and a binomial covariate based on whether or not shrimp flies were used. Years with limited observations were removed (2009 and 2020). CPUE data analysis used sdmTMB with a negative binomial model to fit the yellowtail catch in numbers, applying a log effort offset for angler hours. Treatment was not found to be a significant factor influencing CPUE in model selection, so this covariate was not included in the modeled index. None of the gear covariate variations were found to be significant factors in model selection, or the strata-specific sample sizes were limited, which did not allow for model convergence; therefore, a gear covariate was not included either. The final dataset contained 1,972 observations (Table XX – percent pos.)

Two full model series were considered, one including all the potential covariates with a regional covariate and one with a survey (or state) covariate substituted for region. In the time series with region, the gear covariate (binary) was not significant; thus, the best fit model according to AIC included year, region, drift depth (binned), and month. However, the QQ plot for this model was not ideal, so a second model series with survey was developed. In this second series, the gear categorizations were re-evaluated and again, the gear covariates were either non-significant or did not allow for model convergence. Thus, the best fit model according to AIC included year, survey, drift depth (binned), and month (Table XX – Model Selection). Acceptable diagnostics were achieved when this model was fitted via MLE using the sdmTMB R package (Version 0.6.0) (Figure XX – QQplot). The final index of abundance is shown in Table XX/Figure XX.

### SMURF YOY Index

ODFW and Oregon State University (OSU) have collaborated on young of the year (YOY) fish and environmental monitoring in and around Oregon Marine Reserves (MR) using SMURF devices, which are standardized sampling units that collect newly-settled juvenile fishes. Data were provided for two regions on the Oregon coast, near the Otter Rock MR (central) and the Redfish Rocks MR (southern) with a site inside of the reserve and a comparison site outside of the reserve from 2011 to the present. These are monitored regularly (approximately every 2 weeks) during the settlement season (April - September) and YOY are collected for genetic identification and measured. Settlement rate of YOY Yellowtail Rockfish was provided by OSU for each site within each region. Paired temperature at depth data was provided by ODFW MR Ecological Monitoring team for this assessment. Daily mean temperature data was provided for three depth strata (1m, 7.5m, and 15m) for each site within each region.

Oceanographic sampling by the ODFW MR Ecological Monitoring team has not been able to be done simultaneously in both reserves at each mooring site at all depths due to a lack of equipment. However, for time periods when there was matched data, temperature was highly correlated across depths (Pearson’s correlation coefficient \> 0.90) and between sites within each region (Pearson’s correlation coefficients \>0.98). In order to calculate an index of daily water column temperature that was continuous enough to be combined with settlement rate data, temperature data was standardized within year and depth. For periods with multiple observations, the mean was taken in order to generate a single continuous temperature time series. Mean SMURF deployment lasted 15.5 days. In order to summarize temperature in an ecologically meaningful way relative to the SMURF sampling design, a 16-day rolling mean of temperature and cumulative degree days over 16-day periods were calculated. These data were matched with settlement rate data such that the mean temperature or the cumulative degree days during the 16-day period that the SMURF was deployed was used.

Covariates that were evaluated included year, month, region (Redfish Rocks or Otter Rock), temperature, and site (within marine reserve or nearby comparison site). Preliminary model runs indicated a consistent lack of convergence and additional filters were applied to address this, including limiting the data to 2014 - 2024 and to the peak months of settlement for yellowtail (May - July). Temperature covariates explored were all binned into quantiles, depending on the range of the specific tempature covariate. Month was not included in models that included temperature as both covariates were used to describe seasonal variation in settlement rate. Site was not a significant covariate in this model but this was not unexpected, as the presence of a reserve would not be anticipated to impact juvenile settlement rates. Models were fit to the settlement rate data (YOY fish per day) using \gls{sdmtmb} R package (Version 0.6.0) [@Anderson_2024_SRP]. Both negative binomial and tweedie distributions were evaluated. The model that was selected based on fit (@tbl-smurf_mod_select) and expert opinion from OSU and ODFW staff. The final model contained year, region, and temperature summarized as cumulative degree days 16-days prior to SMURF recovery using a negative binomial distribution. Acceptable model convergence and other diagnostic criteria for the final index were achieved (@fig-smurfqq). The index of YOY abundance and associated standard errors are shown in @fig-smurfindex and @tbl-smurf_index.

### Biological data

Length and age data were available from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and \gls{s-tri} (Tables \ref{tbl-wcgbts-bio} and \ref{tbl-tri-bio}). There were 17,329 length observations in the \gls{s-wcgbt} data set, of which only 22 were unsexed, so the unsexed samples were excluded. There were 14,275 lengths in the \gls{s-tri}, none of which were unsexed. Composition data were processed using the {nwfscSurvey} R package [@Wetzel2025]. Ages from the \gls{s-wcgbt} were conditioned on length while the age data from the \gls{s-tri} were processed as marginal distributions. For the conditional age-at-length data, the number of fish within each length bin within each sex is used as the input sample size. The input sample sizes for the marginal distributions are based on the formula of Stewart and Hamel [-@Stewart2014] as $\text{Input N}_{y} = 2.43*N_{tow}$ where the scalar was estimated for a group of 17 slope rockfish, including Yellowtail Rockfish. Unsexed length compositions from the combined ODFW/WDFW survey are also included without any expansions, using number of fish as the input sample size. Length compositions were filtered to reflect those included in the final filtered CPUE index (n = 1,658 fish).

## Ageing error

<!-- see Rscripts\process_double_reads.R for the data processing and analysis -->

The age composition data was based on age estimates provided by two labs, \gls{wdfw} and the Cooperative Ageing Project (CAP) under the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. There were a total of 6,339 otoliths with multiple age readings, 4,402 aged by WDFW readers only, 1,716 by CAP readers only, and 221 aged by readers from both labs.

A series of models estimating ageing error were explored to estimate variability in age estimates as a function of age and to test for differences among labs and among readers. This analysis was conducted using the {AgeingError} software package [@punt_ageingerror_2025] which is based on Punt et al. [-@punt_quantifying_2008]. The estimated differences between the two labs was negligible: the labs differed by an average of 0.6%, or less than 0.25 years for a 40-year-old fish. Similarly, the estimated CV of the age reads was similar between labs: 0.0615 for the WDFW lab and 0.0595 for the CAP lab. The differences among readers within labs were likewise small. Therefore, the most parsimonous model was chosen, which was to treat all readers equally and estimate a single CV parameter relating ageing uncertainty to age. The estimated CV was 0.0606 which this corresponds to a standard deviation of 1.2 years for a 20-year old fish and 2.4 years at age 40. This estimate is similar to the results of the ageing uncertainty estimation in the 2017 assessment and indicates that ageing is more precise than for many other west coast groundfish. The relatively precise ageing is corraborated by one of the age reader's comments that Yellowtail Rockfish are extremely easy to age (B. Kamikawa, pers. comm.).

## Biological Parameters

### Natural Mortality

The model freely estimates natural mortality. However, a lognormal prior based on maximum age is applied [@hamel2022development]. The maximum age used for the prior is 43 years, which is the 99.9th percentile of all ages available in \gls{pacfin}. Because so much age data is available, use of the absolute maximum age observed is subject to influence from outliers. This maximum age is associated with a median natural mortality rate of 0.126 yr$^{-1}$. 

### Weight-at-length

Sex-specific weight-at-length was estimated using a log-transformed linear regression and then bias corrected to predict mean weight-at-length rather than median weight-at-length. Initial data exploration indicated that some years tended to have consistently negative or positive residuals to this single regression equation (i.e., fish condition varies across time). A time-varying weight length relationship was explored as a sensitivity. At present, time-varying biology can bias reference point calculations in the stock synthesis modeling platform (R. Methot pers. comm.), so this was not considered a good choice for a base model. The weight length relationship used was $W =$`r mod_in$ctl$MG_parms['Wtlen_1_Fem_GP_1', 'INIT']`$L$ ADD PLOTS. 

### Maturity

We used a total of 292 individual histological samples of aged female yellowtail rockfish to estimate maturity for the assessment. These samples were all collected north of 40.167; this latitude filter excluded 5 additional samples collected in the south, but the inclusion or exclusion of these samples did not change our results. The 292 samples were collected over the period 2016—2023, though more samples were collected earlier in these years (n = 111 in 2016, 52 in 2017, 31 in 2018, 17 in 2021, 9 in 2022, 13 in 2023). Previous assessments of yellowtail estimated length-based maturity (L50 = 42.49cm in 2017 assessment); however, we switched to an age based model for the current assessment. For many species, energy is reallocated toward maturation from growth, and as a result growth rates slow during the juvenile to adult transition period. Thus, length at 50% maturity will represent a range of ages, providing a less accurate understanding of the spawning population. We treated maturity as a binomial response, and considered a variety of models with temporal and spatial covariates, using a logit link and generalized linear mixed model framework, implemented the R package sdmTMB [@Anderson_2024_SRP]. Briefly, we considered models that included (1) temporal year effects (either estimated as a random walk intercept, or smooth term), (2) spatial random fields (using a mesh cutoff distance of 50km), and (3) spatially varying coefficients of age, following the model adopted by Grandin et al. [-@grandin_status_2024]. Models that converged were compared by examining QQ plots, AUC metrics, and AIC scores. Likely because of the uneven temporal distribution of sampling, and general sparsity, we did not find support for including temporal or spatial effects, and decided on the simpler null model (equivalent to a logistic regression). For the age-based model, we estimated an intercept of -6.70 (SE = 0.99) and slope of 0.67 (SE = 0.10), equivalent to an A50 of 10.0 years. For a more direct comparison to the previous assessment, we used these same 292 samples to fit an equivalent length – based model, which resulted in an estimated L50 = 42.5 cm.

### Oceanographic Index

Over the past several years, progress has been made in understanding how oceanographic conditions drive recruitment of groundfish species in the California Current Ecosystem across lifestages including petrale sole, sablefish and Pacific hake. Recent increases in capacity supported by the Climate, Ecosystem, and Fisheries Initiative provided the ability to build on these previous lines of research and examine the relationship between northern Yellowtail Rockfish recruitment and oceanographic drivers based on model output from Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis (GLORYS) from [Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) (CMEMS) and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model for the California Current Ecosystem [@neveu2016ROMS]. The results suggest that GLORYS and ROMS output may allow for better model precision and near-term forecasting. This approach builds on previous research (@tolimieri_oceanographic_2018; @haltuch_oceanographic_2020; @vestfals2023stage) and assessments (@Taylor_petrale_2023; @berger_status_2023; @grandin_status_2024) by applying similar techniques to establish oceanographic relationships and develop an oceanographic index based on a conceptual life history model for Yellowtail Rockfish [@Darby]. GLORYS also provides a temporally robust time series and is not susceptible to discontinuities identified in the 2023 petrale sole assessment. Appendix A of this report describes the most recent efforts in developing a new environmental index of northern Yellowtail recruitment based on GLORYS products. The final selected model included the date of spring transition from the Coastal Upwelling Transport Index, degree days (which represents temperature exposure) during egg fertilization and development, long-shore transport during the pelagic juvenile lifestage, and El Nino conditions during the pelagic juvenile lifestage. The oceanographic model was fit using the recruitment deviations (1994 - 2019) from the base model and used to predict log recruitment deviations for the next five years, 2020 - 2024, using oceanographic conditions.

## Data sources evaluated, but not used in the assessment model

### Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (RREAS)

The Southwest Fishery Science Center has conducted a standardized pelagic juvenile trawl survey RREAS during May and June every year since 1983 [@Ralston2013interannual; @Sakuma2016; @Field2021]. A primary purpose of the survey is to estimate the abundance of pelagic juvenile rockfishes (*Sebastes spp.*) and to develop indices of year-class strength for use in groundfish stock assessments on the U. S. West Coast. This is especially critical for northern Yellowtail, which rarely appear in the NOAA bottom trawl survey until they are 7 years old. Past assessments have used data from this survey to provide indices of year-class strength (as relative age 0 abundance), including assessments for Black Rockfish in California [@Dick2023], Blue/Deacon Rockfish [@Dick2017], Widow Rockfish [@Adams2019], Bocaccio [@He2015], Shortbelly Rockfish [@Field2007] and Chilipepper Rockfish [@Field2015]. Here we summarize the dataset description from @Dick2023.

Historically, the survey was conducted between 36°30' and 38°20' N latitude (the ‘core area’ from approximately Carmel to just north of Point Reyes, CA), but starting in 2004 the spatial coverage expanded to cover from the U.S./Mexico border to Cape Mendocino. Additionally, since 2001 data are available from comparable surveys conducted by the Pacific Whiting Conservation Cooperative (2001-2009) and the Northwest Fisheries Science Center “Pre-recruit” survey (2011-2022) for waters off of Oregon and Washington [@Field2021]. Coastwide data have revealed both spatial differences in species composition (e.g. north and south of Point Conception) and interannual shifts in the distribution of most pelagic juvenile rockfishes. The near absence of fish in the core survey area during the 2005-2007 period, which saw two of the lowest abundance levels of juvenile rockfish ever observed in the core area time series, was associated with an apparent redistribution of fish, both to the north and the south [@Ralston2013]. As the core area index seems to have failed to capture the magnitude of the 1999 year class for most stocks, the recommendations from the juvenile rockfish survey workshop held in 2005 were to use only the coastwide data (since 2001) for juvenile indices rather than the longer-term ‘core area’ indices unless a convincing case could be made otherwise. 

We considered data from the RREAS survey for northern Yellowtail from 2001 to 2024, the period for which we have coastwide coverage. On account of the COVID-19 pandemic, sampling in 2020 was very limited and restricted to the historical core area. In the years 2010, 2012, and 2022, sampling did not span the entire coastwide spatial domain, with data lacking from northern CA and OR. A coastwide index of abundance from RREAS survey data was considered for inclusion in this assessment. In addition we included the juvenile rockfish index for the northern California Current Ecosystem from @Gasbarro2025 in our comparison of juvenile abundance datasets (@fig-YOY), but this index was only considered for comparative purporses and was not considered for the assessment model based on recommendations from the juvenile rockfish survey workshop.

### Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary Dive Survey
Data from young of year dive surveys conducted between 2015 and 2024 from waters within the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) were provided by Nick Tolimieri and Ole Shelton (NWFSC). These data were first considered for use in stocks assessment in @Cope2023wa. The survey uses SCUBA and belt transects to estimate rockfish abundance, where Yellowtail are identified as a Black-Yellowtail (BYT) complex based on coarsely binned (2-5cm) length compositions. Detailed description of survey methods and aims are found in [@Tolimieri2023]. The YOY survey is interpreted as an index of age-o abundance, though admittedly a rough one as it combines Yellowtail Rockfish and Black Rockfish because they are indistinguishable visually at the surveyed size and age. For the purposes of this assessment, these data are compared to other indices of YOY and recruitment trends to consider shared patterns in variability and whether the trends in these data are consistent with the trends in the overall assessment and across other indices. Indices for the YOY surveys are shown in @fig-YOY.

### Juvenile abundance index considerations

RREAS survey data indicate that juvenile Yellowtail may be distributed further south than 40°10', and may move northward later in life. RREAS data indicate that when YOY are encountered it tends to be in northern California [FIGURE], albeit they are still encountered infrequently. In comparison, young individuals (less than 30 cm and approximately 4.5 years of age or younger) have the highest probability of occurrence off the the coast of of southern Oregon [FIGURE] based off of the bottom trawl survey, in agreement with SMURF data. Adults have the highest probability of occurrence in coastal Washington [Figure].
