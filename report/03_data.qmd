#### Oregon ORBS Dockside Index (2001 - 2024)

Trip-level catch-per-unit-effort data from ORBS dockside sampling was obtained from ODFW. To mitigate the confounding of hourly effort associated with these trips with travel, the travel time was subtracted from the hours fished. Travel time was stratified by boat type (charter and private) and was calculated as boat type-specific speeds (13 mph for charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips) multiplied by twice the distance between the port of origin and the reef that was fished. CPUE, expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated by multiplying the number of anglers and the adjusted travel time. The database contains information on catch by species (number of retained fish), effort (angler hours), sample location (port where data were collected), date, bag limits and other relevant regulations, boat type (charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom associated fish).

The unfiltered data set contained 456,172 trips from 2001 - 2024. Multiple standardized filters are applied to ORBS trip-level data to remove outliers and data unsuitable for an index. These filters include trips with incorrect interview times, which impact calculation of effort, unreasonably long or short trips, and retaining only bottomfish target trips. Further filters were utilized for fishing closures (i.e. temporal or spatial closures) and catches exceeding bag limits, which would presumably impact catch rates. Trips from several ports with extremely small sample sizes (\<1% of total trips) were also excluded and finally, trips that met criteria for irrational effort reporting (i.e., implausible values) or extreme catch rates were excluded as well. The final dataset included 136,475 trips (TABLE “percent_pos.csv”).

Covariates evaluated included year, month, port, the open depths to fishing (all depths or inside 20/30/40fm), boat type and the daily bag limit for Yellowtail Rockfish. Preliminary model explorations indicated that the daily bag limit covariate could not be combined with the open depth of the fishery due to changes in recreational fishing regulations over time. Prior to 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were included in the general marine bag limit. However, in 2017, Yellowtail Rockfish were also included in a specialized longleader recreational bag limit where participants were required to be outside of 40fm. As a result, two series of models were explored, one series that included the open depth of the fishery and a binary covariate indicating whether a trip was a longleader trip and a second series that substituted the daily bag limit for these two covariates. Negative binomial models were fit in sdmTMB (Version 0.6.0) to the trip-level data (catch with a log offset for adjusted angler hours). Tweedie distributions were also explored for selected models but generally did not improve model diagnostics. The final model selected includes year, month, port, open fishery depths and the longleader trip covariates, which was the best fit model by AIC in this series (TABLE “model_selection.csv”). No models from the series that included the daily bag limit converged, so these were not considered further. Acceptable diagnostics for the model were achieved (FIGURE – qqplot) and the negative binomial distribution was preferred over the tweedie. The index of abundance are shown in Figure/Table XXXX.

### Maturity

We used a total of 292 individual histological samples of aged female yellowtail rockfish to estimate maturity for the assessment. These samples were all collected north of 40.167; this latitude filter excluded 5 additional samples collected in the south, but the inclusion or exclusion of these samples did not change our results. The 292 samples were collected over the period 2016—2023, though more samples were collected earlier in these years (n = 111 in 2016, 52 in 2017, 31 in 2018, 17 in 2021, 9 in 2022, 13 in 2023). Previous assessments of yellowtail estimated length-based maturity (L50 = 42.49cm in 2017 assessment); however, we switched to an age based model for the current assessment. For many species, energy is reallocated toward maturation from growth, and as a result growth rates slow during the juvenile to adult transition period. Thus, length at 50% maturity will represent a range of ages, providing a less accurate understanding of the spawning population. We treated maturity as a binomial response, and considered a variety of models with temporal and spatial covariates, using a logit link and generalized linear mixed model framework, implemented the R package sdmTMB [@Anderson:2024:SRP]. Briefly, we considered models that included (1) temporal year effects (either estimated as a random walk intercept, or smooth term), (2) spatial random fields (using a mesh cutoff distance of 50km), and (3) spatially varying coefficients of age, following the model adopted by Grandin et al. [-@grandin_status_2024]. Models that converged were compared by examining QQ plots, AUC metrics, and AIC scores. Likely because of the uneven temporal distribution of sampling, and general sparsity, we did not find support for including temporal or spatial effects, and decided on the simpler null model (equivalent to a logistic regression). For the age-based model, we estimated an intercept of -6.70 (SE = 0.99) and slope of 0.67 (SE = 0.10), equivalent to an A50 of 13.31 years. For a more direct comparison to the previous assessment, we used these same 292 samples to fit an equivalent length – based model, which resulted in an estimated L50 = 43.35 cm.
