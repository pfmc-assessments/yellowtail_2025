## Data

![Data presence by year for each fleet, where circle area is relative within a data type. Circles are proportional to total catch for catches; to precision for indices, discards, and mean body weight observations; and to total sample size for compositions and mean weight- or length-at-age observations. Observations excluded from the likelihood have equal size for all years.](r4ss_plots/data_plot2.png){fig-alt='Tabular information for this figure can be found in the data file.' #fig-data}

## Fits to Data

## Time-series

![Comparison of time series of age 4+ biomass for Yellowtail Rockfish across past assessments. Previous assessments were focused only on the area north of 40Â°10', but some also included a small area within Canada. The 2013 assessment used the data-moderate approach and the line represents the posterior median of a Sampling Importance Resampling](Figures\historical_assessment_timeseries.png){fig-alt='A time series of 13 colored lines showing estimates from 9 different assessment. The majority of the lines had similar scale and declined at a similar rate in the 1970s and 80s, but whereas the assessments conducted between 1991 and 2005 show one-way trips, those conducted in 2013 and onward show increases starting between 1990 and 2000. The current base model shows a lower scale than the previous assessment.' #fig-historical}
