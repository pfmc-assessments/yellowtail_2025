![Comparison of time series of age 4+ biomass for Yellowtail Rockfish across past assessments. Previous assessments were focused only on the area north of 40∘10′, but some also included a small area within Canada.

The majority of the lines had similar scale and declined at a similar rate in the 1970s and 80s, but whereas the assessments conducted between 1991 and 2005 show one-way trips, those conducted in 2013 and onward show increases starting between 1990 and 2000. The current base model shows a lower scale than the previous assessment.' #fig-historical}
