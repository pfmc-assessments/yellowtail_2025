### Sensitivity analyses

![Comparison of various management quantities across all sensitivities. Metrics are terminal year relative spawning output, fishing mortality rate at SPR = 0.5, yield at SPR = 0.5, unfished spawning output, and terminal year spawning output. Bars at the top of the figure represent 95% confidence intervals for the metrics in the base model.
